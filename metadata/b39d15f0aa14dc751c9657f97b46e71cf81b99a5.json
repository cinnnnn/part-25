Blue-eyed, light-haired and fair-skinned, White Folks was to become the most incredible con man the ghetto ever spawned. Long White Con takes up where Trick Baby left off. After the death of his partner and mentor, Blue Howard, White Folks hooks up with the Vicksburg Kid, who completes his con education. Together they form a formidable duo, playing for the highest stakes, pulling off the most ambitious con of the lot - The Unhappy Virgin Game. Fleecing wealthy fools is the name of the game but when the sums involved get to the levels seen in Long White Con, the consequences of any slip can be fatal. Like all of Iceberg Slim's work, Long White Con takes the reader into a world rarely seen in print, combining wicked humour with streetwise knowledge and philosophy. The result is another page-turning classic of hard-boiled fiction.
