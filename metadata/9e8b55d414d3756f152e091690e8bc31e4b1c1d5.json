Gigantic bull fur seals attack king penguins who, despite their severe weight disadvantage, put up one of the most spirited defences ever filmed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e8b55d414d3756f152e091690e8bc31e4b1c1d5","amp;dn":"Planet+Earth%3A+Shallow+Seas+1080i.DivX.AC3.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e8b55d414d3756f152e091690e8bc31e4b1c1d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,139,85,212,20,211,117,111,21,46,9,22,144,232,188,49,228,177,193,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
