She is one of the most popular female vocalists ever. But her voice really shines in here. Her &quot;soneo&quot;, which means vocal improvising (not scat - it involves improvising lyrics based on a refrain) is absolutely enthralling. \r\nAt the time of this CD she was not yet too well-known - nowadays she is, in the words of Celia Cruz (a pillar of Latin music), the undisputed Princess of Salsa. Her more recent albums have included ballads that lean more to latin-pop, but fortunately not sappy or sugary at all. Her intense delivery is always a delight for the ears and the soul. \r\nThe only thing that made me not give this a full score is the fact that we get the song &quot;Solitude&quot; in 3 versions. I think that's a bit much of the same. But nonetheless, this is a fine introduction to one of the most fiery, and passionate vocalists you are likely to find. \r\nLa India is definitely a rare talent, and she is from Puerto Rico, so it makes me proud.
