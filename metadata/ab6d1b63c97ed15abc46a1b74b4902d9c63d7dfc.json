After his expulsion from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1861, Cushing managed to get an appointment as a master's mate on one of the warships of a blockading squadron. Cushing's daring and exceptional performance in battle led to a spectacular rise in rank, responsibility, and reputation. His military career culminated in his torpedoing of the Confederate ironclad Albermarle on the Roanoke River in 1864, an operation he executed under heavy enemy fire. This new and fully annotated edition of Cushing's memoir, originally written in 1867/1868, conveys the excitement and drama of a truly extraordinary Civil War naval career.\n\n# Hardcover: 184 pages\n# Publisher: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers; annotated edition edition (August 16, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0742570533\n# ISBN-13: 978-0742570535","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab6d1b63c97ed15abc46a1b74b4902d9c63d7dfc","amp;dn":"The+Sea+Eagle+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab6d1b63c97ed15abc46a1b74b4902d9c63d7dfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,109,27,99,201,126,209,90,188,70,161,183,75,73,2,217,198,61,125,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
