Real estate and renovation experts, Property Brothers Drew and Jonathan Scott, come to the rescue and help the couple find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time. With a budget that doesn't match the couple's expectations, Drew and Jonathan struggle to sell the potential of an extreme fixer-upper. A tough decision between two renovation projects has to be made and the couple finally pulls the trigger. The brothers now only have five weeks to completely transform the house as promised. Tensions arise when the renovation exposes leaky pipes and rotted flooring structure that threatens the couple's budget and move-in date. Katherine and Jordan bring the in-laws in to roll up and their sleeves and get to work.\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfcacc05cc42a3376214e31cda2e86ad455e5d50","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s02e05.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfcacc05cc42a3376214e31cda2e86ad455e5d50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,202,204,5,204,66,163,55,98,20,227,28,218,46,134,173,69,94,93,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
