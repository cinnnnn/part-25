Wife and Widow\n9. Roll! Black Ocean!\n10. Estela\n11. Undrown Yourself\n\n\n&quot;Hilarious Death Blues is a dark, smoldering journey into isolated Americana. It&amp;#039;s country music that&amp;#039;s silently aware of the impending apocalypse, and doesn&amp;#039;t pine over lost love and and the daily grind of an oppressive job. It&amp;#039;s a low and lonesome sound that holds a mirror to existential angst and rages against entropy, ennui, murk and miasma with flourishing, poetic beauty.&quot;\n--Chad Radford\n\n\nIf you like it, I&amp;#039;d encourage you to buy it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaf41d3e74b0e231ac41beba2ce2efcc83dd7c7c","amp;dn":"Antic+Clay+-+Hilarious+Death+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaf41d3e74b0e231ac41beba2ce2efcc83dd7c7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,244,29,62,116,176,226,49,172,65,190,186,44,226,239,204,131,221,124,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
