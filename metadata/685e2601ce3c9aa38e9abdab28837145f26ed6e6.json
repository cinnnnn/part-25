The year 2010 marks the birth centenary of Chandra. His unique style of research, inward bound, seeking a personal perspective to master a particular field, and then pass on to another was so unique that it will draw considerable interest and attention among scholars.\n\nAs Chandra elucidates in the preface, &quot;The various installments describe in detail the evolution of my scientific work during the past forty years and records each investigation, describing the doubts and the successes, the trials and the tribulations. And the parts my various associates and assistants played in the completion of the different investigations are detailed&quot;. It is indeed a remarkable and rare document, fascinating to read and experience the joys, frustrations and struggles of a creative mind.\n\n# Paperback: 296 pages\n# Publisher: World Scientific Publishing Company (January 4, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 9814299588\n# ISBN-13: 978-9814299589","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:685e2601ce3c9aa38e9abdab28837145f26ed6e6","amp;dn":"A+Scientific+Autobiography%3A+S.+Chandrasekhar+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"685e2601ce3c9aa38e9abdab28837145f26ed6e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,94,38,1,206,60,154,163,142,154,189,171,40,131,113,69,242,110,214,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
