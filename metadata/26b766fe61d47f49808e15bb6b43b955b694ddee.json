For over 15 years, Caroline Myss has worked face to face with the real experts on this controversial subject: thousands of people challenged by illnesses who failed to respond to conventional treatment. As a medical intuitive, Myss saw beyond their physical complaints-and identified the greatest block to healing in our culture today. She shows that when we stop using illness as a way to gain power and intimacy with others, we stop wasting our sacred energy. It then becomes available, not only for self-healing, but for spiritual fulfillment. Here is a bold new vision of healing, presented by Caroline Myss in her own words, that will electrify you with its unlimited possibilities for improved health and spiritual connection. Includes an exclusive interview with Caroline Myss.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26b766fe61d47f49808e15bb6b43b955b694ddee","amp;dn":"Why+People+Don%27t+Heal+-+Caroline+Myss+%282+CDs%2C+mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26b766fe61d47f49808e15bb6b43b955b694ddee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,183,102,254,97,212,127,73,128,142,21,187,107,67,185,85,182,148,221,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
