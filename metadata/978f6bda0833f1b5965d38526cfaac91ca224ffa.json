San Diego, Calif., attorney Madriani and Harry Hinds, his longtime partner, agree to represent Carl Arnsberg, a racist facing execution for the bludgeoning-by-hammer murder of author Terry Scarborough, whose nonfiction bestseller, Perpetual Slaves, has actually led to riots in the streets. Scarborough focused the U.S. public on the retention in the Constitution of offensive language defining African-Americans as three-fifths human, despite subsequent amendments overriding those statements. He intended to follow Perpetual Slaves with a sequel that would reveal the existence of a secret letter written by Thomas Jefferson whose contents Scarborough believed would prove even more incendiary. Madriani and his team race frantically to trace a copy of that letter, which disappeared from the victim's briefcase at about the time of his murder. Compelling courtroom scenes, which display a sophisticated knowledge of legal trench warfare, compensate for some less-than-credible plot twists.

All rights reserved.\n\nFrom Booklist:\nDefense attorney Paul Madriani and his partner, Harry Hinds, return (after Double Tap, 2005) in this somewhat implausible but gripping legal thriller. A writer with his eye on the best-seller list, Terry Scarborough writes a book about how the U.S. Constitution still contains the language of slavery in its text. As the national debate over the idea of a racist Constitution escalates, Scarborough is killed before heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s able to drop another bomb in his next book: a letter allegedly written by Thomas Jefferson that will further deepen the racial divide. Enter Madriani and Hinds, hired to defend the accused murderer, a white supremacist who might just have been in the wrong place at the wrong time. The defense team realizes that finding that letter is the key to their clientÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s defense. Though not the best entry in this strong seriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the plotting is a bit disjointedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the mix of racial tension and courtroom drama combines for a suspenseful thriller. --Mary Frances Wilkens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:978f6bda0833f1b5965d38526cfaac91ca224ffa","amp;dn":"Shadow+of+Power%3A+A+Paul+Madriani+Novel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"978f6bda0833f1b5965d38526cfaac91ca224ffa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,143,107,218,8,51,241,181,150,93,56,82,108,250,172,145,202,34,79,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
