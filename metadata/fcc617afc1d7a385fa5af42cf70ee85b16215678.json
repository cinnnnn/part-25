In the nova of this historic moment, with an economic recession threatening their home, Zan, his wife and their son set out to solve the enigma of a little girl whose body is a radio, broadcasting a future rhythm &amp; blues that circles the sphere of time.  Scattered across two continents, the family meets a mysterious stranger with a secret who sends the story spiraling forty years into the past, from '60s London to '70s Berlin, from the ground zero of civilization to a New World mid-air in its leap of imagination.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcc617afc1d7a385fa5af42cf70ee85b16215678","amp;dn":"These+Dreams+of+You+-+Steve+Erickson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcc617afc1d7a385fa5af42cf70ee85b16215678","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,198,23,175,193,215,163,133,250,90,244,44,247,14,232,91,22,33,86,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
