Shot over three years, the film shows the struggle of two understated pioneers - Zafar Iqbal, a Muslim from Woking Borough Council, and Elizabeth Cuttle, a local Surrey history enthusiast - as they battle to get this small plot of land restored and recogonised as a symbol of an important and largely unknown part of British history. Using archive material and interviews with historians and surviving descendants, the film also reveals the stories of some of the Muslim soldiers once buried here, and through their experiences the history of the Muslim contribution to the British war effort in World War I unfolds. The film ends with the voices of modern Muslims who believe this shared narrative is one of the ways that prejudice and distrust of Islam in modern Britain might be overcome.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 21 (~2500Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~122Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 39 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 731 MB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba968c2e80eed15aee46b383f08fccc4e45643ff","amp;dn":"Britains+Muslim+Soldiers+720p+HDTV+x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba968c2e80eed15aee46b383f08fccc4e45643ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,150,140,46,128,238,209,90,238,70,179,131,240,143,204,196,228,86,67,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
