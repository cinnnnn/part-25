In parallel case studiesÃ¢â‚¬â€of Japanese Americans mobilized to serve in the United States Army and of Koreans recruited or drafted into the Japanese militaryÃ¢â‚¬â€T. Fujitani examines the U.S. and Japanese empires as they struggled to manage racialized populations while waging total war. Fujitani probes governmental policies and analyzes representations of these soldiersÃ¢â‚¬â€on film, in literature, and in archival documentsÃ¢â‚¬â€to reveal how characteristics of racism, nationalism, capitalism, gender politics, and the family changed on both sides. He demonstrates that the United States and Japan became increasingly alike over the course of the war, perhaps most tellingly in their common attempts to disavow racism even as they reproduced it in new ways and forms.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[A] monumental history. . . .
