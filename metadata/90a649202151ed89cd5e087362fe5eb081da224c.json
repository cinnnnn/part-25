She has lost everything, witnessed the unthinkable, and committed herself to a mission with a deadly conclusion. Indoctrinated, trained, and given a ticket to New York, she blends in, posing as an ambitious journalist--an &quot;arrow&quot; hoping to hit too many targets to count.\n\nDr. Sam Watterman is recruited too. Falsely accused and disgraced in the anthrax inquiries after 9/11, he is no longer a believer in causes. But the government that ruined his career now demands his expertise to locate a threat putting millions of Americans in peril.\n\nIn a country that fights wars on foreign soil but remains terrified of the cataclysm at home, Sam strives toward redemption and Daria desperately seeks both rebellion and enlightenment. Their lives will intersect at a place that will test their faith and make them each question what it means to have something worth dying for.\n\n\nWith a riveting plot that spans sixteen fraught, compelling days, Stephen MillerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dazzling novel of literary suspense brings the war to a landscape both familiar and vulnerable: the America we call home.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90a649202151ed89cd5e087362fe5eb081da224c","amp;dn":"Stephen+Miller+-+The+Messenger+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90a649202151ed89cd5e087362fe5eb081da224c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,166,73,32,33,81,237,137,205,94,8,115,98,254,94,176,129,218,34,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
