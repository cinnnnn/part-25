They'd already been making music together for some 40 years or more so, not surprisingly, their playing and singing mesh seamlessly on this collection of previously unreleased recordings, cut in a single day in Chicago in 1974. There's a lightheartedness to the mix of Estes' upper-register vocals (think of him as the anti-Howlin' Wolf) and Nixon's rougher voice and easy rollin' harmonica, which features prominently on all but two tracks, among them &quot;Mary Come on Home,&quot; &quot;80 Highway,&quot; and the opening &quot;Love Grows in Your Heart.&quot; Nixon takes over on lead vocals for the earthy &quot;Potato Diggin' Man,&quot; doubles up on vocals on several numbers, among them a spirited &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In,&quot; and switches from harp to kazoo on &quot;I'll be Glad When You're Dead&quot; and &quot;Corrine Corrina.&quot; Two different takes of &quot;President Kennedy&quot; serve as a reminder of the affection that African-Americans had for the fallen leader. A fine sampling of unadulterated acoustic blues.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4176c0d4b402b4385bd4940fd97c68a07b8e13cd","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Sleepy+John+Estes+-+On+80+Highway","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4176c0d4b402b4385bd4940fd97c68a07b8e13cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,118,192,212,180,2,180,56,91,212,148,15,217,124,104,160,123,142,19,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
