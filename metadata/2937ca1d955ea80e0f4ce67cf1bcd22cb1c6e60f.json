Although he is still doing some sensitive singer/songwriter material, it no longer sounds as awkward. In fact, a couple tracks, like &quot;Weep No More,&quot; are very memorable. On the other hand, &quot;Misty Water Woman&quot; sounds like an overly-melodramatic attempt at being Elton John. Still, the good stuff makes it worth owning. ~ Jim Worbois Includes liner notes by Ken Sharp. All songs written by Rick Springfield.
