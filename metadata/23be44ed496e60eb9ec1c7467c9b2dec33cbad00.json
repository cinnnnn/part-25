Approximately 130 papers were presented at the general sessions in addition to other papers discussed during the poster session. The main purpose of this conference was to bring together representatives from industry, universities, and government agencies to present the latest information on the science and technology of SCC and to discuss research needs and market acceptance of this evolving technology. The RILEM series of symposia started in 1999 in Stockholm, followed by Tokyo in 2001, Reykjavik in 2003, Chicago in 2005, and Ghent in 2007. The North-American Conference on the Design and Use of SCC was held in Chicago in 2002, 2005, and 2008. Both series of conferences enjoyed great success with a steadily increasing number of papers, participants, and interest from across globe.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 453 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (September 1, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 9048196639\n    * ISBN-13: 978-9048196630","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23be44ed496e60eb9ec1c7467c9b2dec33cbad00","amp;dn":"Design%2CProduction+and+Placement+of+Self+Consolidating+Concrete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23be44ed496e60eb9ec1c7467c9b2dec33cbad00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,190,68,237,73,110,96,235,158,193,199,70,124,155,45,236,51,203,173,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
