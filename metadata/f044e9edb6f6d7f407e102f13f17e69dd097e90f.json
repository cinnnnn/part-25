Lengthy protests from abroad at his being denied a visa eventually worked, and he was expecting to travel to France (where he'd initially studied composition), when he died suddenly in 1963. A prolific composer of both symphonies and string quartets, his musical style changed and softened over time, though his attitude towards the government never did.\r\n\r\nThis is the second volume devoted to his string quartets, and includes numbers 5, 7, and 9.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nA bio is enclosed.
