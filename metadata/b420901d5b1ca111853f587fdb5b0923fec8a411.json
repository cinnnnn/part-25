The record is probably more focused than those which followed, but focused on its own eeriness -- the quasi-psychedelic folk vibe has more in common with the Japanese collective Ghost than with the sprawlingly odd Americana of albums like The Emotional Plague. This gives The Unexamined Life a haunting edge that simply isn't captured by the Lou Barlow references that seem appropriate -- there's an antique and wholly psychedelic quality behind the record's drawling folk, and it's that element that lends the album most of its interest.\n\ncd ripped by X Lossless Decoder version 20111015 (136.4)\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b420901d5b1ca111853f587fdb5b0923fec8a411","amp;dn":"Supreme+Dicks...The+Unexamined+Life%281993%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b420901d5b1ca111853f587fdb5b0923fec8a411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,32,144,29,91,28,161,17,133,63,88,127,219,91,9,35,254,200,164,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
