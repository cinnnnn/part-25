Though the last year or two I&amp;#039;ve tried to focus the comic towards Video Games parodies rather than two gamers. And totally random stuff when I&amp;#039;m bored.\n\nWhich brings me to the first thing you probably noticed, those guys are cats! Based off my own kitties (in name only :B). They are;Leo the grey guy and Aeris the pink one. Also filling out the cast is the spawn of the underworld Krug, and defender of pants Pants Man. As well side characters such as Dr. Hobo, Johnny, Major Payne, and Ternaldo.\n\nmore about this webcomic on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VG_Cats\n\nExtras can be found in the Bonus directory and includes:\n\n/about          - the full about webpage from which the above description is taken\n/avatars        - avatars to use on web forums\n/contact        - email adress of webcomic author Scott Ramsoomair\n/extra          - other stuff including models to carve pumpkin\n/fan            - guest art and guest comics\n/links          - graphics to link to www.vgcats.com\n/other_webcomics - previous webcomics by Scott Ransoomair: bad mushrooms, ffxi adventure log\n/wallpapers    - desktop wallpapers\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:922646592fdc97f8c21c9dbdc00681927bb352d2","amp;dn":"webcomic+-+vgcats+complete+collection+to+date+%2B+extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"922646592fdc97f8c21c9dbdc00681927bb352d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,38,70,89,47,220,151,248,194,28,157,189,192,6,129,146,123,179,82,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
