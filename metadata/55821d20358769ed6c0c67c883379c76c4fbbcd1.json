The Darkness is coming. The balance between Order and Chaos is rapidly shifting and the world is falling towards evil and horror, and all the misery that Chaos will bring. But there is hopeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ He is only 12 years old, but he is breaking into the home of one of Freya's richest merchants; and he is doing it tonight. Pardigan has had enough.\n\nA burglary that will change their lives forever sets four friends upon a quest, a race against time, to locate three magical objects and complete an ancient and desperate spell. Sailing their boat The Griffin, the crew are quickly pursued by The Hawk, an evil bounty hunter and master of dark sorcery; and Belial, King of Demons and champion of Chaos who seeks to rule the world of man. Yet first, Belial must capture the crew of The Griffin and end their quest.\n\nGenre: Young Adult | Fantasy | Adventure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55821d20358769ed6c0c67c883379c76c4fbbcd1","amp;dn":"Flight+of+the+Griffin+by+C.+M.+Gray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55821d20358769ed6c0c67c883379c76c4fbbcd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,130,29,32,53,135,105,237,108,12,103,200,131,55,156,118,196,251,188,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
