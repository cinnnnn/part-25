With contributions from the original TV interviewer Paul Young - who had never seen the footage, which was part of a regional television programme broadcast only in Scotland - Beatles expert and writer Mark Lewisohn and Dick Fiddy of the BFI.\n\nWriter and Beatles expert Mark Lewisohn describes the interview as `candid`. \n`It's a special piece that is so laid back it almost falls over,` he says. \n\nOne episode of approximately 30 minutes.\n\nFirst broadcast on Tuesday 1 July 2008 on BBC Radio 4.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:391264c8824c0f5b3f687f5de85ee09d98e8da4c","amp;dn":"The+Lost+Beatles+Interview+-+BBC+Radio+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"391264c8824c0f5b3f687f5de85ee09d98e8da4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,18,100,200,130,76,15,91,63,104,127,93,232,94,224,157,152,232,218,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
