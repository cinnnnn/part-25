It was like, whoa, who made this? I have to see everything he ever did.&quot;\r\n\r\nIn the 1930s, amoral cigar-chomping blonde tommy-gun girl Bonnie Parker cut a swath of bodies across the South-West. Starting out on gas stations and bars with side-kick Guy Darrow she graduated to bank hold-ups with Darrow's brother and, after bloodily springing him from behind bars, her jailed husband. But there was never any doubt about who was in charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 640x480, 25.000 fps, 1420 Kbps, 01h20m31s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, DUAL Audio Tracks English and Spanish, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5vm40ov0j/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/vxb3hpf97/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/vvwkajo1n/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/3uiiwuirf/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/82db5lk6z/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01a9a5e65ce08b6c689060c12eeeb97f7764a927","amp;dn":"The+Bonnie+Parker+Story+%5B1958+-+USA%5D+bank+robbery+noir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01a9a5e65ce08b6c689060c12eeeb97f7764a927","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,169,165,230,92,224,139,108,104,144,96,193,46,238,185,127,119,100,169,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
