I'd seen the documentary already and didn't plan to watch it again, but I did want to keep the musical bits. So I clipped them out and here they are!\n\nThe audio and visual quality of these clips ranges from &quot;very poor&quot; to &quot;decent&quot;. The majority being in the &quot;decent&quot; range I think. It's miraculous really, that these exist at all.\n\nThere are a few extras here that didn't appear in the television documentary broadcast, but came with the same DVD.\n\nAlso, I have numbered the files so as to mix them up a bit. There is no special meaning to the numbering.\n\nHere is the track list:\n\n01. Patsy Cline - A Church A Courtroom and Then Goodbye.avi\n02. Patsy Cline - Come On In 1.avi\n03. Patsy Cline - I've Loved And Lost Again (Ranch Party).avi\n04. Patsy Cline - How Can I Face Tomorrow.avi\n05. Patsy Cline - Walkin' After Midnight 1.avi\n06. Patsy Cline - Let's Go To Church.avi\n07. Patsy Cline - I Fall To Pieces.avi\n08. Patsy Cline - Lovesick Blues.avi\n09. Patsy Cline - She's Got You.avi\n10. Patsy Cline - Three Cigarettes In An Ashtray.avi\n11. Patsy Cline - San Antonio Rose.avi\n12. Patsy Cline - Come On In 2.avi\n13. Patsy Cline - Let It Snow.avi\n14. Patsy Cline - Walkin' After Midnight 2.avi\n15. Patsy Cline - So Wrong.avi\n16. Patsy Cline - Crazy.avi\n\nAll files are XviD/AVI format at 4:3 aspect with an internal frame size of 720x480 (rendered 640x480).\n\nEnjoy!\n\n- user101966\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:116d035504de47b5990d673ce6a56e1daeb295ba","amp;dn":"Patsy.Cline.Video.Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"116d035504de47b5990d673ce6a56e1daeb295ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,109,3,85,4,222,71,181,153,13,103,60,230,165,110,29,174,178,149,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
