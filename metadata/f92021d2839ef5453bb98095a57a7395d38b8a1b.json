Cady (Editor), Elizabeth Shakman Hurd (Editor)\nHardcover: 302 pages\nPublisher: Palgrave Macmillan (April 15, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0230621244\nISBN-13: 978-0230621244\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nComparative Secularisms in a Global Age explores the history and politics of secularism and the public role of religion in France, India, Turkey, and the United States. It interprets the varieties of secularism as a series of evolving and contested processes of defining and remaking religion, rather than a static solution to the challenges posed by religious and political difference. It features essays from leading scholars from across disciplines, secular and religious traditions, and regional expertise. The volume illustrates a new approach to the hotly contested relation between political authority and religious tradition.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;This fascinating and timely volume warns us against assuming any facile understanding of the definition of secularism and the relation between religion and society. The contributors to this volume ably show us how, in the words of the introduction, 'various modes of secularism provide different spaces for religion.'&quot; - Journal of Contemporary Religion\n\n&quot;As the study of secularism continues to expand, this volume crucially extends our knowledge of secularism as a relational category. It de-centers the religion-secular binary and the presumption of European origins in favor of comparative study of France, India, Turkey, and the United States. If you want a better understanding of both histories of secularism and the conflicts driving events in today's world, read this book.&quot; - Janet Jakobsen, Editor with Ann Pellegrini of Secularisms\n\n&quot;This rich collection of essays not only provides deep insight into processes of secularization in France, India, Turkey, and the US, it also enables us to reconceptualize what is meant by 'the secular' and 'the religious.'It adds important empirical and theoretical insight to current conversations on this question and, indeed, reframes the entire debate.&quot; - Joan W. Scott, Harold F. Linder Professor of Social Science, Institute for Advanced Study\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nLinell E.
