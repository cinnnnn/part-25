Includes an\nalternative version of the 'George &amp; The Dragon' story, this time told\nfrom the dragons' perspective, and with a very different result.\n\n&quot;The story I am to tell is about the contention between ourselves &amp;\nmankind on the face of the earth and of the contention within the hearts\nof many creatures stirred by that conflict. It is, above all, about my\nbrother, Amalric, a prince of dragons. He whose valour, love, and honour\nin the end brought upon himself &amp; upon mankind, &amp; upon our nation, a fate\nunthinkable in the days when it yet lay before us, inevitable now when\nafter many years we look back. I will speak first of those happy early days\nand of our noble and beloved Uncle George, commander of the army, former\ndragon errant, and teller of stories to the young.&quot;\n\nA touch portentous at times, but worth suspending disbelief for it for a while.\n\nNB The BBC also broadcast a (not so good) 60 minute version of this one.\n\nCast [spellings suspect]\nGeorge - Robert Stephens \nThesaurus - Alan Bennett \nThe King - Cyril Shaps \nThe Queen - Pauline Letts \nAmalric - David Timson \nThe Narrator, Alcuin - Stephen Thorne\nYoung Alcuin - Jill Lidstone \nTorin - Elizabeth Lindsay \nFelice - Jane Rosamund \nGaila - Kathryn Hurlbutt \nSybil - Christine Absalon \nThe Priest - Alan Dudley \nPhippa - Sonia Fraser \nHarold - Alexander John \nKaylor - John Rye \nBalyn - Michael Spice \nAmic - John Hollis \nPonds - Hadyn Wood \nGwendal - Stephen Garlick\n\nOther warriors &amp; dragons\nJohn McAndrew\nJoe Dunlop\nAleric Cotter\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4860830614c469d2f0d8937be70693f6eb23e62a","amp;dn":"BBC+R4+-+Don+Haworth%5C%27s+%5C%27Dragon%5C%27+sp7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4860830614c469d2f0d8937be70693f6eb23e62a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,96,131,6,20,196,105,210,240,216,147,123,231,6,147,246,235,35,230,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
