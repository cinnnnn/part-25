A few ballads are exquisite, and some up-tempo numbers, especially Lamont Dozier&amp;#039;s &quot;Going Back to My Roots,&quot; are dancefloor gems.\n\nThere is something for everybody here with its timeless dance tracks like New York city girl, Use it up, Back to my roots to big power ballads such as &quot;looking for a way out&quot;.\n\n\n\n01.
