However, when you purchase Microsoft Windows 7 from Microsoft Store, you have an additional choice to make: whether to download a collection of compressed files or to download an ISO file. An ISO file combines all the Windows 7 installation files into a single uncompressed file.\nIf you choose to download an ISO file (so that you can create a bootable file from a DVD or USB flash drive), copy your Windows 7 ISO file onto your media and, run the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool. After you do this, you can install Windows 7 onto your computer directly from the USB flash drive or DVD.\nNOTE: When you download the ISO file, you must copy the file onto a USB flash drive or a DVD to install Windows 7. When you're ready to install Windows 7, insert the USB flash drive into your USB port or insert your DVD into your DVD drive, and then run Setup.exe from the root folder on the drive.\nThe advantage to following this process and creating bootable media is that it allows you to install Windows 7 without having to first run an existing operating system on your machine. If you change the boot order of drives in your computer's BIOS, you can run the Windows 7 installation directly from your USB flash drive or from a DVD when you first turn your computer on. (Please see the documentation for your computer for information about how to change the BIOS boot order of drives.)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c17f8132d021c17287e46ac60afa2b737627b3b0","amp;dn":"Windows+7+USB%2FDVD+tool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c17f8132d021c17287e46ac60afa2b737627b3b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,127,129,50,208,33,193,114,135,228,106,198,10,250,43,115,118,39,179,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
