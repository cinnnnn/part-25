Above all, it provides an insight into how Descartes conceived of natural philosophy before he started to reformulate his doctrines in terms of a sceptically driven epistemology. Of its two parts, the Treatise on Light introduced the first comprehensive, quantitative version of a mechanistic natural philosophy, supplying a theory of matter, a physical optics, and a cosmology. The Treatise on Man provided the first comprehensive mechanist physiology. This volume also includes translations of material important for an understanding of the work: related sections from the Dioptrics and the Meteors, and an English translation of the complete text of The Description of the Human Body.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Important text for understanding DescartesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ later major works ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Provides an alternative translation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Useful introduction, chronology and notes on further reading\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8ecf9f56eb06f35793e8642cae425c7461240c7","amp;dn":"Descartes+-+The+World+and+Other+Writings+%28CUP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8ecf9f56eb06f35793e8642cae425c7461240c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,236,249,245,110,176,111,53,121,62,134,66,202,228,37,199,70,18,64,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
