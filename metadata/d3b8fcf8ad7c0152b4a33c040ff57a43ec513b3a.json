Krantz.\n\n\n# ISBN-13: 9780387489087 \n# Publisher: Springer New York\n# Publication year: 2011\n# Edition number: 1\n# Pages: 264\n\n\nThis text explores the many transformations that the mathematical proof has undergone from its inception to its versatile, present-day use, considering the advent of high-speed computing machines. Though there are many truths to be discovered in this book, by the end it is clear that there is no formalized approach or standard method of discovery to date. Most of the proofs are discussed in detail with figures and equations accompanying them, allowing both the professional mathematician and those less familiar with mathematics to derive the same joy from reading this book.\n\n\nContents\n========\n\n   1.
