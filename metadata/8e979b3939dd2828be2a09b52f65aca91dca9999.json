One of his         \n    favourite fruits is the British plum, many varieties of   \n    which are now seriously under threat. He meets farmers     \n    who are struggling to sell their plums, many of which     \n    lie rotting on the orchard floor because there is no     \n    longer a viable market for them, and die-hard lovers of   \n    plums who, like him, are determined to revive the          \n    fortunes of this classic British fruit. In the Revival    \n    kitchen, Raymond creates a range of amazing dishes that  \n    are so mouthwatering that they make you want to go and    \n    plant your own plum tree.                                  \n                                                              \n    Michelin-starred chef Angela Hartnett's campaign is to   \n    persuade us to cook with turkey outside of the            \n    Christmas season. She wants to reverse the perception      \n    of turkey as an over-cooked, dry meat that we only eat    \n    once a year and encourages us to embrace the             \n    slower-reared heritage varieties of turkey that produce   \n    succulent, tasty meat. Angela is determined to get us      \n    to be more experimental with turkey and cooks up some     \n    tasty treats to prove just how versatile this healthy    \n    and affordable alternative to chicken really is.          \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                                  \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n           &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0178b12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0178b12&lt;/a&gt;           \n       BBC HD audio switching stuck again so audio is 2.0     \n       @ 384.                                                \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e979b3939dd2828be2a09b52f65aca91dca9999","amp;dn":"Great.British.Food.Revival.S02E05.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e979b3939dd2828be2a09b52f65aca91dca9999","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,151,155,57,57,221,40,40,190,42,9,181,47,101,172,169,29,202,153,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
