I can't recommend these albums enough. They are like modern Brazilian music with an indie twist. Cibelle has an absolutely incredible voice, one of a kind style and an artistic and beautiful soul.  \n\n1. Self titled debut LP\n\n2. The Shrine of Dried Electric Leaves\n\nThese are good complementary albums to go along with Suba's SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Paulo Confessions, which featured Cibelle's vocals. \n\nBoth of these records hold up very well after repeated listens. \n\nEnjoy ;)\n\nBrazilian singer Cibelle was just a five-year-old child in SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Paulo when she told her mother she wanted to start taking guitar lessons. Her mother agreed, and Cibelle moved around from instrument to instrument, trying her hand at the piano, percussion, and voice. As a teenager she was more interested in acting, appearing in commercials and promotional spots on MTV Brazil, but eventually realized that singing was her true passion and started performing at jam sessions around the city. It was at one of these sessions that she met the then-unknown Yugoslavian DJ Suba, who performed his version of synth-heavy samba for the crowd. Cibelle was intrigued by his interpretation of Brazilian music and, at a friendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s urging, got up on-stage to sing with him. Suba was so impressed that he invited her to come to his home recording studio to work on an album, what would later become the seminal SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Paulo Confessions. Though the producer died tragically shortly after the recordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s release, Cibelle continued on, appearing on guitarist and singer/songwriter Celso FonsecaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2003 album, Natural, and releasing her own self-titled debut album on Six Degrees/Ziriguiboom. She followed up in 2004 with her EP About a Girl, and two years later Shine of Dried Electric Leaves, which featured duets with Seu Jorge and Devendra Banhart, came out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4acf7cbd07f90bc0fe9ba01cae83dff9bd06d55","amp;dn":"Cibelle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4acf7cbd07f90bc0fe9ba01cae83dff9bd06d55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,172,247,203,208,127,144,188,15,233,186,1,202,232,61,255,155,208,109,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
