West Country Murders brings together over 50 cases from the authors' previous collections, and some completely new ones, here in one volume. They include stories of those who killed for greed, jealousy and lust, as well as those who committed murder in what a well-known judge once described as 'a gust of passion'. Some of the killers were undoubtedly insane at the time of their crimes; others were almost certainly innocent, yet paid the ultimate price for a murder they did not commit. Some remain unsolved to this day, despite the best efforts of the local constabularies. This book is sure to appeal to all those interested in the shady side of the West Country's history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c37af41fe4416d4867a6ddbb1e2b1cca77f9bc13","amp;dn":"West+Country+Murders+-+Nicola+Sly+%26amp%3B+John+Van+Der+Kiste.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c37af41fe4416d4867a6ddbb1e2b1cca77f9bc13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,122,244,31,228,65,109,72,103,166,221,187,30,43,28,202,119,249,188,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
