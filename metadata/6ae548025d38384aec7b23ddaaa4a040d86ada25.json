Now that Taffy has moved to Mystic Creek, Oregon, to start over, she unexpectedly meets the one man who might help her get Sarah back. \r\n\r\nBarney Sterling, a local lawman, finds himself drawn to the lovely, guarded Taffy, but he's stunned by her proposition - that they marry immediately to improve her chances of regaining custody of her daughter. Barney takes marriage too seriously to commit himself to a woman he hardly knows. Yet soon his sympathies fall with the desperate Taffy, and pretending to be in love becomes the easiest part of the plan. But they have no idea what they're up against or what they're willing to risk to make a miracle come true in Mystic Creek","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ae548025d38384aec7b23ddaaa4a040d86ada25","amp;dn":"NEW+LEAF+audiobook+by+CATHERINE+ANDERSON+EarReaders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ae548025d38384aec7b23ddaaa4a040d86ada25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,229,72,2,93,56,56,74,236,123,35,221,170,164,160,64,216,106,218,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
