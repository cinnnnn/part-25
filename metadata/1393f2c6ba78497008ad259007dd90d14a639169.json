It includes most of their singles, as well as three new songs, &quot;Not the Girl You Think You Are&quot;, &quot;Instinct&quot;, and &quot;Everything Is Good for You&quot;.\n\nRecurring Dream was also released in a two-disc version, the second disc being titled Special Edition Live Album. Five of the live album's songs are from the same concert, at The Civic Theater in Newcastle, Australia. Other songs from this performance have appeared as B-sides, including &quot;Chocolate Cake&quot; on the &quot;Instinct&quot; single. The recording of &quot;Fingers of Love&quot; comes from Paul Hester's final show, in Atlanta, before he quit the band.\n \nOn a personal note. I borrowed my brothers copy of this CD and when I first heard the live album, my jaw just dropped. It's outstanding, especially the Newcastle tracks. This limited edition release is out of print, but I managed to find a pristine copy in a second hand store......and I'm sharing my good fortune with all of you !!\n \nEnjoy !! Crowded House at their very best.
