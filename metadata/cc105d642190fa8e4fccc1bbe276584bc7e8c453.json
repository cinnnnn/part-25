Dennis returns to his discussion of the multiple crises in the Middle East. \n LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stop officially apologizing for things we didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do. Bowing to the cultural sensitivities of Islamists\n is not helping anyone, including MuslimsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Why wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the President meet with the Prime Minister of Israel\n during his visit to NYC?\n\n\nPrager 20120912    2 Male/Female Hour: Open Lines\n\nPrager H2... Before callers weigh in, Dennis states that one clear advantage of marrying young is that you share \n a lifetime of memories. Questions include: do you believe husbands should stay in shape for their wives;\n why do you say that a successful marriage takes luck; with the power of the visual in men, \n if a woman is a regular occurrence in a husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, how should a wife handle that?\n\n\nPrager 20120912    1 Murder is Worse\n\nPrager H1... A Youtube video supposedly attacking Muhammad, sparked protests against U.S. interests in Egypt\n and Libya yesterday. In Libya, the attackers killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\n Dennis talks with Daniel Pipes, President of The Middle East Forum, about the past 24 hours.\n Dennis reminds us all that murder is worse than mockery, and that we, as a country, have nothing to apologize\n for with regards to this situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Download, seed, and spread the word. \n\n\nMore Stuff is here\nRush, Michael Savage, Mark Levin, Dennis Prager\nthepiratebay . se / user / CAPTAIN7SS/0/3\nbeta . demonoid . me / files / ?seeded=2&amp;uid=7492662\n\nRush Shows and Neal Boortz Shows Live are here\nthepiratebay . se / user / amuck5 /\n\nLaura Ingraham podcasts are here\nthepiratebay . se / user / freedomczar /\n\nGlenn Beck Insider podcasts are here\nthepiratebay . se / search / glenn%20beck/0/99/100\n\nPodcasts of the Rush Limbaugh Show are here (temporarily stopped uploading)\nthepiratebay . se / user / Annoyme /\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc105d642190fa8e4fccc1bbe276584bc7e8c453","amp;dn":"The+Dennis+Prager+Radio+Show+SEP-12-2012+WED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc105d642190fa8e4fccc1bbe276584bc7e8c453","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,16,93,100,33,144,250,142,79,204,193,187,226,118,88,75,199,232,196,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
