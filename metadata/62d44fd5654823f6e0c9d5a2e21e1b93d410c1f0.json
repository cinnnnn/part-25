Angered, Graham posites that several recent murders were all the work of a copycat patterning after recent serial murders, and that Georgia was killed because she may have remembered the face of whoever had killed Dr. Sutcliffe. Crawford, bothered by Graham's behavior and by Hannibal's apparent concealment of Graham's hallucinations, discovers the pattern that shows Abigail was present during Garrett's victim selection processes. Crawford confronts Hannibal's therapist, and she later tells Hannibal that she didn't reveal deatils about her attack by a previous therapist patient. After releasing himself from the hospital, Graham takes Abigail Hobbs back to Minnesota, to the hunting lodge. During a hallucination he deduces, correctly, that Abigail was an active participant in her father's murders. Fleeing from Graham, Hannibal comforts Abigail and admits to having killed more people than her father. The episode ends with the implication that Hannibal is going to murder Abigail and have Graham blamed with the murder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62d44fd5654823f6e0c9d5a2e21e1b93d410c1f0","amp;dn":"Hannibal+S01E12+XviD+%5BJKS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62d44fd5654823f6e0c9d5a2e21e1b93d410c1f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,212,79,213,101,72,35,246,224,201,213,162,226,30,27,147,212,16,193,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
