The pristine melodies are influenced by jazz and pop. Virtuoso, sensitive and unique interpretations - the duo's own songs and conversational improvisations occasionally seasoned with vocal harmony or steel guitar (Richard Krantz), trumpet (Emil Strandberg) and bass clarinet (Nils Berg).\nErika Alexandersson is a recent graduate of the School of Music at GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶teborg University. Another project of Erika's is the Ohman-Alexandersson duo, free improvisations with the drummer Martin Ohman. She also composes music for string quartets and vocals in her project Speak Low. Bassist Josef Kallerdahl is much in demand, and has collaborated with groups such as the New Tango Orquesta, the ballad singer Dan Viktor and the trio Music Music Music.
