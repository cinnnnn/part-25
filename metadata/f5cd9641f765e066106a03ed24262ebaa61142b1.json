J. Wang (World Scientific, 2011).pdf\n\nISBN 9789814313186\n\nThis book consists of important contributions by world-renowned experts on adaptive high-order methods in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). It covers several widely used, and still intensively researched methods, including the discontinuous Galerkin, residual distribution, finite volume, differential quadrature, spectral volume, spectral difference, PNPM, and correction procedure via reconstruction methods. The main focus is applications in aerospace engineering, but the book should also be useful in many other engineering disciplines including mechanical, chemical and electrical engineering. Since many of these methods are still evolving, the book will be an excellent reference for researchers and graduate students to gain an understanding of the state of the art and remaining challenges in high-order CFD methods","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5cd9641f765e066106a03ed24262ebaa61142b1","amp;dn":"Adaptive+High-Order+Methods+in+Computational+Fluid+Dynamics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5cd9641f765e066106a03ed24262ebaa61142b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,205,150,65,247,101,224,102,16,106,3,237,36,38,46,186,166,17,66,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
