Frank was a hitman who was killed in a car accident, then stitched back together and brought to life by a pair of mad scientists.  This resurrection leaves Frank with supernatural reflexes and a slight degree of precognitive and empathic power.  Frank doesn't remember anything about his former life and now lives as a jack-of-all-trades wanderer, accompanied by a variety of allies.\n\nCreated by Mike Allred.\n\nRe-uploaded to include Madman Atomic Comics #10 and appearances.\n\n\nTracked by http://comicpirates.info\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4f71691b27c9b51259557d1fcd03c4f7a037e36","amp;dn":"Madman+%28Mike+Allred%29+Re-Upload","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4f71691b27c9b51259557d1fcd03c4f7a037e36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,247,22,145,178,124,155,81,37,149,87,209,252,208,60,79,122,3,126,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
