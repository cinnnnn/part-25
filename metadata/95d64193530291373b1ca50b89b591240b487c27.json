Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nIgnacio Larranaga is almost unknown in the English-speaking world, and this book is almost impossible to find in print form. But Larranaga shouldn't be neglected - he's a very fine spiritual writer. This book is what you might call a spiritual biography of St. Francis of Assisi.\n\nI strongly recommend Larranaga's Sensing Your Hidden Presence, the only book still in print in English by Larranaga.\n\n\npublisher description:\n\nThis book originally appeared as 'El Hermano de Asis,' Cefepal, Santiago de Chile, 1989. \n\nThe works of Ignacio Larranaga provide analysis and solutions, doctrines and orientations for the needs and problems of the whole person. They are a summary of the total mystery of a person and his needs - a summary that has helped millions and millions of people to experience the joy of interior liberation and the joy of living. Now, the message of father Larranaga is becoming available to English-speaking readers. \n\nAlthough the author is a Catholic writer, his message is valid for any Christian, any believer, and simply, for any man or woman, as already proved in many nations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95d64193530291373b1ca50b89b591240b487c27","amp;dn":"Ignacio+Larranaga+-+Brother+Francis+of+Assisi+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95d64193530291373b1ca50b89b591240b487c27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,214,65,147,83,2,145,55,59,28,165,11,137,181,145,36,11,72,124,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
