Play\nPLEASE REMEMBER TO SEED, MANY OTHERS WANT THIS GAME! :)\nIf you like this game, support the developers and BUY IT!\n\nTitle: DESKTOP DUNGEONS ENHANCED EDITION\nGenre: Strategy - Turn-based - Roguelike\nWorks on: Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10)\nLanguages: Audio and text: English\nModes: Single-player\nReleased: November 7, 2013\nSize: 257 MB\nCompany: QCF Design / QCF Design\nStore page: https://www.gog.com/game/desktop_dungeons\n\nAbout:\nThe Desktop Dungeons: Enhanced Edition has arrived.\nNow with new content and quests, new classes (that's 21 total now if you've been keeping count) and a new way to play: For the first time ever, compete against your friends (or the world at large) in the seeded Daily Dungeon.\nEnhanced Edition features:\nSecretly despise friends for already beating you on the Daily Dungeon leaderboards. Unlock a terrifying new building for your Kingdom. \nDiscover the Rat Monarch and Chemist classes... and their reasons for visiting the Kingdom. \nClick through new quests and ignore exposition as it streams past you. \nGleefully and accurately sling spells from the player-requested drag-to-cast and radial menus. \nPages and pages of optimizations and bug fixes that are awesome but don't sound cool when we put them in lists like this one.\nDesktop Dungeons is a quick-play, roguelike-like puzzle game that gives you 10-20 minutes of dungeon-crawling action per serving. Casual players can enjoy endless coffee-break gaming sessions in infinitely random dungeons, while hardcore enthusiasts can unearth the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subtleties and tackle challenges of unrealistic viciousness. Down all paths lies frequent death, easy accessibility and the urge to play just one more dungeon.\nCloud save notice: Desktop Dungeons has a completely optional cloud-saving system that's useful if you plan to play the same Kingdom on multiple machines, the browser version and mobile versions (coming soon). Your unique cloud-key can be found under My Account. This key must be redeemed here to create an in-game account.\nThe perfect coffee-break game: Fight your way through fantasy dungeons in as little as 10 minutes.\nNever the same thing twice: Each dungeon is randomly generated, yet winnable. Explore the finely-tuned gameplay as you learn more and more impressive ways to beat vicious bosses and unlock new items, gods and heroes to play.\nPrize-winning awesomeness: Classic roguelike play re-imagined as a unique single-screen puzzle adventure that won Excellence in Design at the 13th Annual IGF Awards.\n\nThe Goatperson DLC adds a new playable class to Desktop Dungeons' already large roster of characters. The Goatperson is a throwback to roguelike gameplay of yesteryear, answering the oft-asked question &quot;What would Desktop Dungeons be like if you had to eat food like regular roguelikes?&quot;, the less-oft-asked question &quot;What do Goatpeople eat anyways?&quot; and the briefly-asked &quot;Why did we just switch gods?&quot;.\nThis DLC also contains a new building, the aptly named Goat Glade, which houses a useful Item Lottery for players with more gold than sense, as well as a series of unique Triple Quests that pit players against three randomly generated dungeons in a row (reminiscent of the infamous campaign in the Desktop Dungeons alpha). Each Triple Quest reveals new knowledge about the world of Desktop Dungeons.\nBrowser version notice: in order to enjoy the DLC features in your browser version, please use them first in your desktop version and save the game via the the cloud-saving system.\n\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10, 1.2 GHz Processor, 1 GB RAM, Any Direct3D 9 (or later) graphics card, 350 MB HDD space, Mouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85516c06a2daf3bf3bc6270fce7cff848d35a80a","amp;dn":"Desktop+Dungeons%3A+Enhanced+Edition+Incl+Goatperson+DLC+%282.5.0.7%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85516c06a2daf3bf3bc6270fce7cff848d35a80a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,81,108,6,162,218,243,191,59,198,39,15,206,124,255,132,141,53,168,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
