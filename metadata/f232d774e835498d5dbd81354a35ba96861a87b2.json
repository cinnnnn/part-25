Farmer and dog trainer Dave Graham ('Farmer Dave' of Big Brother fame) is hunting for solutions to the dilemma surrounding Australia's native canine, the dingo. A secretive and stealthy predator, dingoes are responsible for devastating livestock losses. Farmers, in defence of their livelihoods, have long retaliated with culling. It's a battle for survival, and it's escalating. But is the dingo really a villain? New research shows that the dingo may play a pivotal role in protecting Australian ecosystems. Sadly, this research also shows that the pure dingo is on the brink of extinction, making way to the crossbred &quot;wild dogs&quot; who pose a much greater threat. Featuring stunning behavioural photography and a wide cast of passionate stakeholders, this documentary is a must see for both dog lovers and working farmers as it attempts to unravel the complex emotional debate around living in harmony with our native dingo.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c48cada3ac8488f0eaf4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2002 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps AC3 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 1\n * Part Size: 685 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: PDTV\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://eden.uktv.co.uk/dingo-wild-dogs-war/article/about-dingo-wild-dogs-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://eden.uktv.co.uk/dingo-wild-dogs-war/article/about-dingo-wild-dogs-war/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f232d774e835498d5dbd81354a35ba96861a87b2","amp;dn":"UKTV+Dingo+Wild+Dogs+at+War+PDTV+x264+AC3+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f232d774e835498d5dbd81354a35ba96861a87b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,50,215,116,232,53,73,141,93,189,129,53,74,53,186,150,134,26,135,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
