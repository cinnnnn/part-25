There are thousands of different skins to choose from that are freely downloadable from the WindowBlinds website.\n\nA WindowBlinds skin can change Windows to look like an alternative operating system, favorite sports car brands, favorite sports team, or virtually anything else.\n\nWith modern video cards, WindowBlinds can do this without reducing performance. WindowBlinds 6 adds the ability to have ?blurred glass? window borders on Windows XP which allows artists to make skins that could make Windows XP look virtually identical to Windows Vista.\n\nWindowBlinds is safe and easy to use. It doesn't alter any system files and users can switch between the default Windows look and feel and a custom WindowBlinds skin with the click of a button.
