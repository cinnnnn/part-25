Updated and more practical than ever, Natural Gas Hydrates, Third Edition helps managers and engineers get up to speed on all the most common hydrate types, how to forecast when they will appear, and safely mitigate their removal. Known for being highly flammable, gas hydrates are a preventable threat that can costs millions of dollars in damage, as well as take the lives of workers and engineers on the rig. The third edition of Natural Gas Hydrates is enhanced with todayâ€™s more complex yet practical utilization needs including:\r\n\r\nNew hydrate types and formers, including mercaptans and other sulfur compounds\r\nVital information on how to handle hydrate formation in the wellbore, useful information in light of the Macondo explosion and resulting oil spill\r\nMore detailed phase diagrams, such as ternary systems, as well as more relevant multicomponent mixtures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuantifiably measure the conditions that make hydrates possible and mitigate the right equipment correctly\r\nPredict and examine the conditions at which hydrates form with simple and complex calculation exercises\r\nGain knowledge and review lessons learned from new real-world case studies and examples, covering capital costs, dehydration, and new computer methods","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e48f097d2aae5e77e9a97f7e696c0f6e265da8f2","amp;dn":"Natural+Gas+Hydrates+-+A+Guide+for+Engineers+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e48f097d2aae5e77e9a97f7e696c0f6e265da8f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,143,9,125,42,174,94,119,233,169,127,126,105,108,15,110,38,93,168,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
