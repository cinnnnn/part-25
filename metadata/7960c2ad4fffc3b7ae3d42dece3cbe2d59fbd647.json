Now, there&amp;#039;s a lighter, more efficient, and cheaper alternative: Battery Doubler! Because it doesn&amp;#039;t use standard techniques (dim screen light, etc.), but finds out what to turns off what isn&amp;#039;t needed, such as, for example, the USB ports, you can get up to twice autonomy without sacrifice comfort.\n\n\n*Decrease recharge time\nYour battery recharges much faster if your computer isn&amp;#039;t turned on. That&amp;#039;s a fact. Let Battery Doubler redefine a few computer facts - with its Turbo Charge technology, increase up to 10 battery recharge speed when your computer is turned on.\n\n\n*Recalibrate damaged batteries\nAfter using your battery a lot without paying attention to discharge and recharge it fully every time, its performance becomes very low.
