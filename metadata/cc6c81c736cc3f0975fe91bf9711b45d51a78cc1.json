Man In The Box (clean version)\n\n\n5. Would?\n* Solo guitar removed from the intro.\n* Before last chorus you can hear reverb effects not included in the original\n* Layne's vocal is much lower during the chorus compared to the original.\n\n6. Them Bones\n* extra kick and snare drum added are out of time during the first 2-4 seconds\n\n\n9. What the Hell Have I\n* Citar guitar almost inaudible. Pretty heavy mix compared to the original one. \n* Not the same mix included in the Music Bank compilation, The Essential 2 cds and Bank Heist.\n\n\n12. I Stay Away\n* Extra guitars and strings not found on other versions \n* The highlight of this DVD\n\n13. Grind\n* Extended Layne and Jerry vocals (cut on the original edit/tracking)\n\n\n15. Again\n* The second highlight from this DVD. \n\n16. Over Now (MTV Unplugged)\n* Layne's vocal louder\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc6c81c736cc3f0975fe91bf9711b45d51a78cc1","amp;dn":"Alice+In+Chains+-+Music+Bank+The+Videos+FLAC16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc6c81c736cc3f0975fe91bf9711b45d51a78cc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,108,129,199,54,204,63,9,117,254,145,191,151,17,180,93,81,167,140,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
