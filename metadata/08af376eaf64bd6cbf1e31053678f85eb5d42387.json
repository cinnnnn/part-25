Alex chooses to prey only on criminals and street derelicts, devoting more of his time to pursue a greater hunger for books on the occult, a passion surpassed only by his tragic love for a beautiful woman whom he lost to his ancient rival, the vampire-hunting Edgar (Kenneth Cranham).Alex's past returns to haunt him in more ways than one: as he enters a tenuous relationship with a quiet, morose librarian (Suzanna Hamilton) whose sad-eyed beauty reminds him of his lost love, the still-vindictive Edgar -- now a vampire himself -- returns to settle the score by abducting her. Though leisurely paced, this seldom-seen sleeper is driven by excellent performances, gorgeous photography, and a simple but compelling script that artfully combines subtle chills with bittersweet romance (including fitting excerpts from Edgar Allan Poe's &quot;Annabel Lee&quot;), all draped in a fog-bound Gothic ambience of dripping candles, billowing curtains, and crumbling stone pillars.\n\nCast overview, first billed only:\n\nJulian Sands \t\t... \tAlex\nSuzanna Hamilton \t... \tAnne / Virginia\nKenneth Cranham\t \t... \tEdgar\nMarion Diamond \t\t... \tDenise\nMichael Kenton \t\t... \tMagazine Man\nCatherine Blake\t \t... \tVirginia (5)\nMark Kempner \t\t... \tMorgue Official\nNik Myers\t\t... \tRent Boy / Newscaster's Voice\nKen Pritchard \t\t... \tBum 1\nIan Rollison \t\t... \tBum 2\nDavid King \t\t... \tWaiter\nAdrianne Alexander \t... \tProstitute\nMark Motileb \t\t... \tChild\nKeri Motileb \t\t... \tChild\nLisa Motileb \t\t... \tChild ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08af376eaf64bd6cbf1e31053678f85eb5d42387","amp;dn":"Tale+of+a+Vampire+%281992%29+-+Julian+Sands%2C+Suzanna+Hamilton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08af376eaf64bd6cbf1e31053678f85eb5d42387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,175,55,110,175,100,189,108,191,30,49,5,54,120,248,94,181,212,35,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
