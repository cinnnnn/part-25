It's taken at a funky pace.\n\nThis recording has been issued and re-issued under various guises and titles \nunder Hendrixs's name both on vinyl and CD.(&quot;Woke up this morning and found myself dead&quot; being the most famous) Even came out as a bootleg back in the 70s. \n\nThe sound is of typical poor bootleg quality and the musicianship is well below par with screaming obscenities being hurled from Jim Morrisons corner that would make the likes of Marilyn Manson blush.(on &quot;Uranus Blues&quot; Well, what more do you expect with a title like that?? \n\nThe whole session turned into something of a joke inspite of Jimi trying to inject some seriousness into it.Like the original LP i think the CD should carry an 'advisory&quot; label because it's as obscene in places than the vilest rap record today. \n\nNot for the faint hearted. \n________________________________________________\n\n1 Red House   10:57\n\n2 Woke Up This Morning and You Find Yourself Dead   8:05\n\n3 Bleeding Heart   12:29\n\n4 Morrison's Lament   3:30\n\n5 Tomorrow Never Knows   5:11\n\n6 Uranus Rock   3:11\n\n7 Outside Woman Blues   8:03\n\n8 Sunshine of Your Love   2:16 \n___________________________________\n\nMp3\n\nRipped:320kbs\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0703c1426ac534eb81c6c3320bae48c0c84457d","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+Bleeding+Heart%28mp3+320kbs%29ICM369","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0703c1426ac534eb81c6c3320bae48c0c84457d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,112,60,20,38,172,83,78,184,28,108,51,32,186,228,140,12,132,69,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
