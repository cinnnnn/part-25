There is a phenomena occurring in America today. People are beginning to listen to an inner voice deep within their hearts. That voice is encouraging them to move our country closer to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLaws of Nature and of NatureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s God.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThat is what the founders referred to in our Declaration of Independence as the source of authority for our separation from England. COMMON SENSE; Revisited explains why that is happening and how a return to founding principles can help us solve the many problems that face our country. This SPECIAL EDITION was written to transform hearts and minds. We believe it does justice to its predecessor, COMMON SENSE written by Thomas Paine in 1776, which changed the course of the world.\n\n\nNote: you get one chance in this life time.\n\n-sig\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/1c1385103961eaf0bc327b67f04e1c2c&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/1c1385103961eaf0bc327b67f04e1c2c&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52639391e0acb17aec4c66b34889cb2be324f7e0","amp;dn":"Republic-Magazine9.Common.Sense.Liberty.Freedom.2008-sig.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52639391e0acb17aec4c66b34889cb2be324f7e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,99,147,145,224,172,177,122,236,76,102,179,72,137,203,43,227,36,247,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
