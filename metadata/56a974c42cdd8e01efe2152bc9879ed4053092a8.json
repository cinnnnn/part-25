From initially just being able to run a few public domain demos, it&amp;#039;s current state enables many games to boot and actually go in game, such as the &amp;#039;famous&amp;#039; Final Fantasy X or Devil May Cry 3.\n----\n\nI have added various plugins as well as fixed exe for patches also utilities to input code breaker codes and to transfer gamefaqs.com savestates to emu memory card.\n\nEnjoy this awesome Emu that runs FFX, FFX-2, Disgaea and other cool games I have yet to try!\n\nDuckman\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56a974c42cdd8e01efe2152bc9879ed4053092a8","amp;dn":"PCSX+0.9.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56a974c42cdd8e01efe2152bc9879ed4053092a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,169,116,196,44,221,142,1,239,226,21,43,201,135,158,212,5,48,146,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
