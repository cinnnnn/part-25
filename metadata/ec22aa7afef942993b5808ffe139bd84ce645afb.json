Medical cannabis entrepreneur and Fort Collins dispensary owner Josh Stanley works aggressively to counter such pressure with radio ads and fund-raisers. As the oldest of 11 kids, Josh relies heavily on several of his brothers to work at the grove and keep his business supplied in medical marijuana. Meanwhile, Sgt. Jim Gerhardt and fellow officers on the North Metro Task Force continue to find illegal grows by residents claiming to be growing medical marijuana. Is the pendulum swinging back to curb the ten-year proliferation of medical marijuana in Colorado?\nEpisode 1: Marijuana Drama\nThe Stanley brothers are growing their medicinal marijuana to sell at their dispensaries throughout the state. But the guys face a problem: their $250,000 crop must be moved before the plants outgrow the space and the crop is lost. Dispensary owner Dawn Clifford and her husband, John, are facing the possibility of their business being shut down due to a proposed marijuana dispensaries ban. Meanwhile, Sgt. Jim Gerhardt is committed to keeping illegal drugs out of the hands of kids.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/3648/marijuanadramascreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/3648/marijuanadramascreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img228.imageshack.us/img228/2531/marijuanadramascreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img228.imageshack.us/img228/2531/marijuanadramascreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img406.imageshack.us/img406/1636/marijuanadramascreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img406.imageshack.us/img406/1636/marijuanadramascreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img99.imageshack.us/img99/2915/marijuanadramascreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img99.imageshack.us/img99/2915/marijuanadramascreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img38.imageshack.us/img38/6534/marijuanadramascreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img38.imageshack.us/img38/6534/marijuanadramascreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img685.imageshack.us/img685/6779/marijuanadramascreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img685.imageshack.us/img685/6779/marijuanadramascreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/6238/marijuanadramascreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/6238/marijuanadramascreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img502.imageshack.us/img502/2854/marijuanadramascreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img502.imageshack.us/img502/2854/marijuanadramascreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/5378/marijuanadramascreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/5378/marijuanadramascreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2184 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 45.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 10\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/american-weed/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/american-weed/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec22aa7afef942993b5808ffe139bd84ce645afb","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+American+Weed+Marijuana+Drama+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec22aa7afef942993b5808ffe139bd84ce645afb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,34,170,122,254,249,66,153,59,88,8,255,225,57,189,132,206,100,90,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
