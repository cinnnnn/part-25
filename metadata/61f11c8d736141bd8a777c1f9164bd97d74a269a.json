The tracks on the album included eight remixes of songs from \nJackson&amp;#039;s previous album HIStory, and five original songs (&quot;Blood on the Dance Floor&quot;, \n&quot;Morphine&quot;, &quot;Superfly Sister&quot;, &quot;Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Is It Scary?&quot;). Jackson dedicated the \nalbum to Sir Elton John to thank him for the support Sir Elton had given him during \nJackson&amp;#039;s struggle with addiction to prescription painkillers. \n \nHistory: \nOn April 2, 1997 the debut single from the album, &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor&quot;, was released in Europe \nThe single peaked at #1 on the UK Singles Chart. The U.S. release of the single was less popular \npeaking at #42 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #19 on the R&amp;B chart. \nThe second single from the album was &quot;Ghosts&quot;, and included the official remix of &quot;HIStory&quot; as a double \na-side track. On May 8, 1997, Jackson, in collaboration with director Stephen King, made a 40 minute \nshort film titled &quot;Ghosts&quot;. The film premiered at the 50th Cannes Film Festival. The short film was \npositively received by critics who attending the premiere screening. The short film helped propel the \nsingle to #5 in the UK. \n&quot;Is It Scary?&quot; was planned as a third single but was never officially released (as of 2006 only a few \nPromos remain). The song was intended to be the theme song for Addams Family Values, but this didn&amp;#039;t \nhappen in the end. It was also featured in the &quot;Ghosts&quot; short film. \nIt has been rumoured that the track &quot;Superfly Sister&quot; is written about the abusive relationship between \nhis sister LaToya Jackson and Jack Gordon. \nOn May 14, 1997, the album was released worldwide, and was given a platinum award from the RIAA in \nOctober 2000, world-wide, the album has sold an estimated 6 million copies  It is listed as the \nbiggest-selling remix album ever. \n \n---- File Information --- \nZrodlo - Source: DVD \nNazwa pliku - File Name:  Michael Jackson - Blood On The Dance Floor [SyNtEr].avi \nWielkosc pliku-Size (in bytes):  73,384,706 \n--- Container Information --- \nTyp pliku - File type:  AVI(.AVI),    Subtype:   OpenDML (AVI v2.0), \nInterleave (in ms):  40,  Preload (in ms): 288 \nVideo: 51.3 MB (73.42%) \nAudio: 18.2 MB (26.01%) \nAVI Overhead: 409 KB (0.57%) \n--- Video Information --- \nVideo Codec: Type: H264/x264,  Name: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC \nCzas-Time (hh:mm:ss):  5:40.800 \nIlosc klatek:  12721176  frames \nObraz Szer x Wys - Size (pixels):  624 x 464 \nStorage Aspect Ratio(SAR):  1.345 \nPixel Aspect Ratio (PAR):  1.000 \nDisplay Aspect Ratio:  1.345 \nKlatek na sek. - FPS :  25.000 \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):  1268 \nKodowanie:  //// \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:  0.175&quot; \n--- Audio Information --- \nAudio Codec:  0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3,  Audio alignment:  Split \nAudio: Sample Rate (Hz):48000, Bitrate(kbps): 448, Bitrate Type: CBR, Channel : 6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61f11c8d736141bd8a777c1f9164bd97d74a269a","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+-+Blood+On+The+Dance+Floor+%5BDVDRip-SyNtEr%5D+%5BAC3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61f11c8d736141bd8a777c1f9164bd97d74a269a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,241,28,141,115,97,65,189,138,119,124,31,145,100,189,151,215,74,38,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
