I never actually intended to become so\ndeeply involved, but as most of us in this fi eld are, I was\ndrawn in and called to it.\nThe fi rst sign of calling came in my teens. I was about\n15 years old when I awoke one night and saw my fi rst apparition,\nmy deceased grandfather standing at the foot of\nmy bed. Actually, I did not know him; he had died when\nI was three years old. But my mother verifi ed my description\nof him.\nPerhaps you could say my calling was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œin the blood,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nas my mother was a twin, and twins have been known\nto be more psychically sensitive than the average person.\nPlus, I was related by blood to one of the most prominent\ninvestigators of the demonic: Ed Warren, my motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\ntwin brother and my uncle. Ed and his wife, Lorraine\nWarren, a clairvoyant, became household names in the\nparanormal and were in media headlines on some of the\nmost famous modern cases on record. Ed has passed on\nnow, and Lorraine still works in the fi eld.\nAs a kid I was always fascinated by the work Ed and\nLorraine did in the paranormal. I wanted to be part of\nit too. But Ed was a stickler for the proper education.\nHe refused to allow me to go along on cases before I\nturned 18, and he spent a lot of time transmitting his\nknowledge to me. I was impatient back then, but Ed, in\nhis wisdom, knew what he was doing. Dealing with the\nparanormal, especially the dark side, is not childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s play\nand requires grounding, education, and discernment. I\nhad to have a base in all of those in order to be properly\nprepared.\nI learned a great deal from my uncle and aunt and\neventually went out on my own. I have been privileged to\nwork with some of the best names in the fi eld, both laypersons,\nlike me, and clergy. I have worked on more than\n7,000 cases: Many of them have had natural explanations\n(that is, not paranormal or demonic), and many others\nhave been resolved with intervention. A few of them have\nbeen full-blown demonic infestations and possessions. I\ndo not perform exorcismsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that is a role for clergyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but\nI have assisted at dozens of these rites.\nOne of the demonic cases brought me face to face with\ngenuine evil: a reptile-like entity that manifested in an\ninfested home, a former funeral parlor in Southington,\nConnecticut, and came at me down a staircase. The intensity\nof the evil was astonishing. I had never before experienced\nanything like it, and I have to admit, I was so\nshaken that it was several days before I could return to\nthe case. I know from my own experience on this case\nand others that evil is real, the demonic exists, and dark\nforces are at work in the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ab8ff666d723008e5ceee2e3fa38852ab82cd9e","amp;dn":"The+Encyclopedia+of+Demons+and+Demonology.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ab8ff666d723008e5ceee2e3fa38852ab82cd9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,184,255,102,109,114,48,8,229,206,238,46,63,163,136,82,171,130,205,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
