Experience Blake Baggettâ€™s newly-developed El Chupacabra Ranch in Florida, one of the most gargantuan home tracks ever made, where Baggett and Ken Roczen enjoy a daily routine of riding light speed fast laps with an almost lackadaisical ease. Three miles away, Aldon Baker trains factory superstars Ryan Dungey, Marvin Musqin and Jason Anderson on a program fit for Seal Team Six. Then thereâ€™s the Smokey Mountains in Idaho, where the Sipes brothers Ryan and Justin go to feel the sweet serenity of a man, his motorcycle, and countless miles of natural single-track. All of these riders are taking moto to territories it has never seen, be that on the stopwatch or the trail map. Thereâ€™s Colton Haaker, the Endurocross phenom whose bike-control and technical abilities are that of superhuman levels. Then of course, Justin Barcia, the exemplar of style on a motocross bike, the guy who defies logic and rides with an amount of panache and flamboyance that is shunned in professional motocross, yet somehow has climbed to the top of the sport. All of these riders and more make up the cast of MOTO 7, and help to make it the most ground-breaking motocross film ever.\r\n\r\nStarring: Blake Baggett, Ken Roczen, Billy Laninovich, Tom Parsons, Kris Foster, Ronnie Renner, Colton Haaker, Anthony Rodriguez, Ryan Sipes, Justin Sipes, Justin Barcia, Adam Enticknap, and more!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:578993e433c415cf9e2383108cb820fb01223971","amp;dn":"MOTO+7+The+Movie+%282015%29+720p+%28motocross+film%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"578993e433c415cf9e2383108cb820fb01223971","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,137,147,228,51,196,21,207,158,35,131,16,140,184,32,251,1,34,57,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
