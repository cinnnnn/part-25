However, Anne-Marie Duff later stated that the director and scriptwriter explicitly told her to play the queen as a life-long virgin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:865f9f8958721b35c8c05d56687d9b43aaa02caf","amp;dn":"The+Virgin+Queen+-+Part+1++%28BBC+2005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"865f9f8958721b35c8c05d56687d9b43aaa02caf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,95,159,137,88,114,27,53,200,192,93,86,104,125,155,67,170,160,44,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
