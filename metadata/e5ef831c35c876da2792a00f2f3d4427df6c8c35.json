I've put in a few\n special filters on the video to dynamically brighten it where\n needed. Colors have also been slightly adjusted and hue has been\n shifted a bit to the blue end. A sharpen filter was also used as\n well as an unsharp mask to bring out some of the edges. As for the\n audio, its the same one as the KingStoner and DiRTYMARY release,\n which means it has high end distortion. There really isn't \n much that can be done about it but I tried my best to make the \n audio a bit clearer. The video is also the same source as DiRTYMARY \n but I've not hardcoded any subs into the video. Realistically you \n don't lose any of the story for the Spanish parts. Finally I will say \n this - for the first few minutes of the movie, the audio distortion\n is at its highest, so it only gets better from there. The audio \n goes a tad out of sync here and there but it comes back into place. \n I'm not the best at it so I did what I could but its there. Also the \n camera at the start moves a few bits but settles in and from there \n only a few minor movements and blurs. So overall I'd say its pretty \n watchable for what we have to work with. And yes, the post scene is \n included.\n\n\n\n\nscreens\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://addpix.net/viewer.php?file=34799128391973124368.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://addpix.net/viewer.php?file=34799128391973124368.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://addpix.net/viewer.php?file=44864808055344341695.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://addpix.net/viewer.php?file=44864808055344341695.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://addpix.net/viewer.php?file=32580358665120219075.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://addpix.net/viewer.php?file=32580358665120219075.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://addpix.net/viewer.php?file=96025097418792874324.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://addpix.net/viewer.php?file=96025097418792874324.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://addpix.net/viewer.php?file=20263474641826046944.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://addpix.net/viewer.php?file=20263474641826046944.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://addpix.net/viewer.php?file=35691907497925854248.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://addpix.net/viewer.php?file=35691907497925854248.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5ef831c35c876da2792a00f2f3d4427df6c8c35","amp;dn":"Fast.and.Furious.6.2013.TS.READNFO.XviD.AC3-NGS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5ef831c35c876da2792a00f2f3d4427df6c8c35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,239,131,28,53,200,118,218,39,146,160,15,47,61,68,39,223,108,140,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
