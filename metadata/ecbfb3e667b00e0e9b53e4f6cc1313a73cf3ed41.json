Learn how to construct dozens of hiding places right in your house and yard. Here are small hiding places for concealing money and jewelry and large places for securing survival supplies or persons. More than 100 drawings show how to turn ordinary items into extraordinary hiding places.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ\tThe outdoor hidies are great for those with their own land. There are several innovative ideas that the other books do not have, including a tree stash. The structural hidies are also different ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ these aren't just making false drawer bottoms. There are pipe, appliance, wall and even drain hidies. Furniture hidies are covered extensively as well, but this review focuses on what makes this book different from the other hiding books.\nOne last strong point of this book is the writing. Throughout, it talks about the psychology of the thief and why some hides work better than others to prevent theft. The main focus is not hiding things from the government or the police, who often have a whole different mindset and a lot more time than a thief does..............................\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecbfb3e667b00e0e9b53e4f6cc1313a73cf3ed41","amp;dn":"How+to+Hide+Anything-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecbfb3e667b00e0e9b53e4f6cc1313a73cf3ed41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,191,179,230,103,176,14,14,155,83,228,246,204,19,19,167,60,243,237,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
