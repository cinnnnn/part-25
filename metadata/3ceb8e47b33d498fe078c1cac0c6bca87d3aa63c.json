Being a multiinstrumentalist and performed with the likes of IN THE LABYRINTH, a painter and true dedicated hippie of the old school. For the first time, Transubstans gathers his 70's recordings into a unique compilation from the time when bands like TYRANNOSAURUS REX, PUGH ROGEFELDT and PINK FLOYD were the main influences. A 16 tracker of how psyched out a Swede could be in the early 70's, armed with a guitar, and odd aditional instruments. This is for friends of JOAKIM SKOGSBERG, PUGH ROGEFELDT, GARY HIGGINS, MEIC STEVENS, ROY HARPER etc etc. And as usual, we provide a fully detailed story about what was then, and what is now.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ceb8e47b33d498fe078c1cac0c6bca87d3aa63c","amp;dn":"Peter+Lindahl+-++Psychedelic+Sweden++2008+Flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ceb8e47b33d498fe078c1cac0c6bca87d3aa63c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,235,142,71,179,61,73,143,224,120,193,202,192,198,188,168,125,58,166,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
