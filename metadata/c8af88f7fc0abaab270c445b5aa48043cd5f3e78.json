Sly Stone\\&amp;#039;s gift as producer and ringleader was to mesh the emerging big-band, good-time funk sound of the late 1960s with an unerring sense of melody, structure and message. The result, on early hits like \\&quot;Dance To The Music\\&quot;, \\&quot;M\\&amp;#039;Lady\\&quot;, \\&quot;Stand\\&quot; and \\&quot;Everyday People\\&quot;, was some of most gleeful, high-spirited and uplifting music ever made. Later, as the 1960s gave way to the long hangover of the 70s and Stone himself descended into drug abuse, sophisticated songs like \\&quot;If You Want Me To Stay\\&quot; and \\&quot;Family Affair\\&quot; took on a melancholic, reflective tinge, while a sharp political edge found its way into \\&quot;Runnin\\&amp;#039; Away\\&quot; and \\&quot;Don\\&amp;#039;t Call Me Nigger, Whitey\\&quot;.
