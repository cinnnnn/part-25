In this case, the weak and the oppressed are the victims of child pornographers; sadly, the criminals are protected by, and in league with, members of the police force. While writer Jerry Kennedy crafts a fairly strong story about horrible crimes against children and the need for justice, murky black-and-white artwork distracts a bit from what could be a very powerful piece of work. Occasionally, shock violence overshadows what could be very well-told story.\n\nThanks goes to Pudgy for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07f2c8321332b80b1ef70ac90c1d785b36d8fc72","amp;dn":"Arizona+-+A+Simple+Horror+1-3+%281998%29+%28Complete%29+%28Pudgy-Novus%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07f2c8321332b80b1ef70ac90c1d785b36d8fc72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,242,200,50,19,50,184,11,30,247,10,201,12,29,120,91,54,216,252,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
