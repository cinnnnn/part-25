The film was directed by Andrew Davis and stars Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. When Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford) is wrongfully convicted for the murder of his wife, and escapes from federal custody, he is declared a fugitive. He sets out to prove his innocence and bring those who were responsible to justice while being pursued relentlessly by a team of U.S. Marshals, led by Deputy Samuel Gerard (Jones).\nU.S. Marshals is a 1998 action thriller film directed by Stuart Baird. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Roy Huggins and John Pogue. The film is a sequel to the 1993 motion picture The Fugitive, which in turn was based on the 1960s television series of the same name, created by Huggins. The events depicted in the story do not involve the fictional protagonist of Dr. Richard Kimble personified by Harrison Ford from the initial film. Instead, an altered plot centers around a different fugitive played by actor Wesley Snipes, who attempts to elude government officials from an international conspiracy scandal. However, some of the actors from the previous film who portrayed Deputy Marshals, reprise their roles in the sequel. The ensemble cast features Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Downey, Jr., Joe Pantoliano, Daniel Roebuck, Tom Wood and LaTanya Richardson.\n\n\n.srt Subtitles included.
