Monami's Mother                                     \n                                                                             \n    Transfer student Monami has a secret and a past that has caught up       \n    with Mizushima. Deceiving Mizushima into eating a token gift of          \n    chocolate, laced with her blood, he is then catapulted into Monami's     \n    vampire world of blood, death and love. Jilted girlfriend Keiko has      \n    other ideas. With a sudden twist of fate, she is then transformed        \n    into the hideous and unforgiving Frankenstein Girl, and the battle       \n    for Mizushima's heart begins.                                            \n                                                                             \n    Proper notes: Both Cowry and our source had hard telecine frames that    \n    were then interlaced. Result = horrible blended fields on Cowry          \n    release. We manually created our own frames, then manually decimated.    \n    Compare the samples of both in sample dir.                               \n    Nuker notes: I'm sure somewhere in these thousands of frames there       \n    are one of two badly blended frames. This does not = bad.itvc or         \n    whatever random nuke you want to use. This is an inexact science,        \n    especially with shitty sources like this.                                \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
