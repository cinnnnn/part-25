There was also a scene featuring David's brother playing basketball with his friends and also another showing a boyfriend helping his girlfriend skateboard.

Towards the end, Archuleta is seen taking shots of the crowd having fun partying with a Sony Cybershot camera.\n\nOn June 24, 2010, Jive Records announced that Something 'Bout Love would be exclusively sold and available for download at David Archuleta's official website on July 13, 2010 and everywhere else on July 20, 2010.
