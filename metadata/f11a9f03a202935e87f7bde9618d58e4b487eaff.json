Recent advances in Computational Biology are covered through a variety of topics. Both inward research (core areas of computational biology and computer science) and outward research (multi-disciplinary, Inter-disciplinary, and applications) will be covered during the conferences. These include: Gene regulation, Gene expression databases, Gene pattern discovery and identification, Genetic network modeling and inference ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f11a9f03a202935e87f7bde9618d58e4b487eaff","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Computational+Biology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f11a9f03a202935e87f7bde9618d58e4b487eaff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,26,159,3,162,2,147,94,135,247,189,233,97,141,88,228,180,135,234,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
