The hard men of the Tumbling B, who had \nsurvived stampede and Kiowa lance to drive their herd up from Big Bend \ncountry, wanted to burn the town down. But Kate Lundy, the Tumbling B&amp;#039;s \nowner, had a better plan. Calling on dozens of seasoned fighters, Kate aimed \nto strangle the town that lived off cowboy money but had no use for the \nTexans themselves. With her rugged foreman, Conn Dury, at her side, the \nproud and beautiful woman might just stand a chance. Because Conn Dury \nknows all about revengeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and in Kate&amp;#039;s wild fight he&amp;#039;s out to get some of his \nown.\n\n----\n\nLouis L&amp;#039;Amour is undoubtedly the bestselling frontier novelist of all time.
