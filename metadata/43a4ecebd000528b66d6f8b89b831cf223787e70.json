That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n=================================\n\nMan the pace has slowed down. I can't believe I'm only putting out about 1 a week now, but many of you are likely glad.  I need to get a bit manic again so I can crank these out. I have decided on the makeup the rest of the torrents - small changes are possible. I plan on 17 more. Most are 13-18gb. The Superman torrent will be around 35-38gb. The big Batman one was popular so I'll do the same with Superman.\n\n39 Secret O-Sha\n40 Sham-Spd\n41 Spe-Stq (Minus Star)\n42 Star*\n43 Str-Supera\n44 Superb-Supq (Minus Superman(Space or Dash) - #44 WILL include titles that start with Superman's\n45 Superman\n46 Supr-Td\n47 Te-Tn\n48 To-Unk\n49 Unl-Waq\n50 War-Wn\n51 Wonder*\n52 World*\n53 Wo-Z (Minus Wonder, World)\n54 Fill Torent A-D\n55 Fill Tor\n\n=================================\n\nToday's offering:  DC from DC from Sa-Secret N\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nS.C.
