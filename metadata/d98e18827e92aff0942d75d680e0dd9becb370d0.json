There are three basic screens: an overworld, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. The player begins the game with a single PokÃƒÂ©mon, and is able to capture more using PokÃƒÂ© Balls.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d98e18827e92aff0942d75d680e0dd9becb370d0","amp;dn":"%5BAcross%5D+Pokemon.Black.%26amp%3B.White+%28NDS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d98e18827e92aff0942d75d680e0dd9becb370d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,142,24,130,126,146,175,240,148,45,117,214,128,224,221,155,236,179,112,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
