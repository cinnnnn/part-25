One of Jakubisko's greatest movies!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis version of an old fairy tale is the second in 20 years (there was a 1954 West German film on the same subject) and is a charming rendering of Frau Holle, who sits on high and watches over humankind and the seasons and one day adopts young Jakob as her assistant. Jakob was part of a travelling circus obliterated by an avalanche and owes his new life to Frau Holle. But back on earth, a certain Elizabeth is being persecuted by an evil stepmother and two sisters, and Jakob is intent on turning that situation around. To achieve his aims, he becomes mortal and returns to earth -- but now Death, taking on the form of a decrepit hag, stalks Jakob. It is up to Frau Holle to save her former ward and see that his mission is completed.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--- File Information --- \n\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: *664,635,392*\nRuntime (# of frames) .: *01:29:50* (*134,739* frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: *DIV3*\nFrame Size ............: *448x336*\nFPS ...................: *25,00*\nVideo Bitrate .........: *916* kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: *0.244* bpp\n\nAudio Codec ...........: *divx (same as wma) (0x0161) DivX Networks*\nSample Rate ...........: *44100* Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: *64 kb/s (32/ch, stereo)\nInterleave ............: *80* ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: *1*\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
