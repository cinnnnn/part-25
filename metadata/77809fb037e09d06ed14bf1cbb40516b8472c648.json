The screenplay was adapted from Robert Shaw's 1967 novel and 1968 stage play, both of the same name. The plot was inspired by images of the trial of Adolf Eichmann.\n\nPlot summary\n\nArthur Goldman is Jewish and a Nazi death camp survivor. Now a rich industrialist, he lives in luxury in a Manhattan high-rise. He banters with his assistant Charlie, often shocking him with his outrageousness and irreverence about aspects of Jewish life. One day, Israeli secret agents kidnap Goldman and take him to Israel for trial on charges of being a Nazi war criminal. Goldman's trial forces his accusers to face not only his presumed guilt, but their own as well.\n\nAt the end it appears that Goldman falsified the dental records which the Israelis used to identify him in order to bring about the trial. When the deception is revealed by the Israeli prosecutor, Goldman is left standing in the trial court's bulletproof glass box, a broken man. The stress shatters his mental health, and he becomes catatonic. He then relives in his mind a Nazi firing squad execution and dies.\n\nAwards and honors\n\nSchell was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama for his performance. Edward Anhalt was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Drama Adapted from Another Medium for his screenplay.\n\nCast\n\nMaximilian Schell\tArthur Goldman\nLois Nettleton\t \tMiriam Rosen\nLawrence Pressman\tCharlie Cohn\nLuther Adler\t \tPresiding Judge\nLloyd Bochner\t \tDr. Churchill\nRobert H.
