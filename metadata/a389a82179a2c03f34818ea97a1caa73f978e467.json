ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s called H.264, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an important new industry standard thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quickly garnered widespread support. Chosen as the industry-standard codec for 3GPP (mobile multimedia), MPEG-4 HD-DVD and Blu-ray, H.264 represents the next generation of video for everything from mobile multimedia to high-definition playback.\n\nImageUltra-efficient, the H.264 codec compresses video tightly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ resulting in much smaller files ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ without sacrificing any quality. So you can watch video of astonishing quality ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ crisp, clear and brilliantly saturated ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in a window up to four times the size you are currently used to seeing.\n\nImageFull Screen Playback\nTired of pillar bars and letterboxes? Full screen playback, now included in the free QuickTime Player, has been enhanced to allow you to take full advantage of your computerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s widescreen display. Select from three different modes to fit your content to any size screen.\n\nImageJust Open It and It Works\nThe new QuickTime 7 Player not only delivers startling quality, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easier to use than ever. It requires no set up for content that streams over the network. Instead, QuickTime 7 Player automatically determines your systemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s connection speed and chooses the highest quality stream for the amount of bandwidth you have available. And if you ever lose a connection while watching streaming video, QuickTime 7 Player automatically reconnects. Now, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s convenience.\n\n\nImageYou also have the option of using the PlayerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new audio and video playback controls. With them, you can easily adjust balance and volume or make changes to bass and treble response. If you're running Mac OS X Tiger or later with a capable video card, you can adjust brightness, color, contrast and tint with sliders in the same control palette, too. Want to speed through a movie? Or really s l o w t h i n g s d o w n? A handy slider lets you set playback speed from 1/2x to 3x normal speed. And by using the new Jog Shuttle, you can adjust the speed at which you search through individual movie frames.\n\nImageSounds Really Good, Too\nDo you think great video deserves great audio? We do, too. And QuickTime 7 Player delivers truly outstanding multi-channel audio. In fact, it provides you with up to 24 channels of audio. So if you watch a movie that offers surround sound, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be amazed at the heightened audio experience youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll enjoy from your Mac or PC and your surround-sound speakers. A really good sport, QuickTime 7 Player supports a wide-range of industry-standard audio formats, including AIFF, WAV, MOV, MP4 (AAC only), CAF and AAC/ADTS.
