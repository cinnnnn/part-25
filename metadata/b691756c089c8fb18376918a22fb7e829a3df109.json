The structural features and characteristics\nundergo changes during many complex chemical reactions. These reactions allow the syntheSis and inter-conversion of millions of compounds. These chemical reactions involving organic cOJ:npounds are known as name reactions. Addition reactions, elimination reactions, substitution reactions, pericyclic reactions, rearrangement reactions and redox reactions are some of the important name reactions haVing vast utility in many fields.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b691756c089c8fb18376918a22fb7e829a3df109","amp;dn":"Organic+Name+Reactions+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b691756c089c8fb18376918a22fb7e829a3df109","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,145,117,108,8,156,143,177,131,118,145,138,34,251,126,130,154,61,241,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
