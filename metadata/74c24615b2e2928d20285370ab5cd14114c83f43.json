AND THE BOYZ - Now That We Found Love (1991)\n\n\n&quot;Three Little Birds&quot; is a song by Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers. It is the fourth track on side two of their 1977 album &quot;Exodus&quot; and was released as a single in 1980. The song reached the Top 20 in the UK, peaking at number 17. It is one of Bob Marley's most popular songs. The song has been covered by numerous other artists. One of the most notable covers was by British singer Connie Talbot, whose version reached number one on the Billboard Hot Singles Sales chart in 2008.\n&quot;Keep On Movin&quot; is a song by Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers from their 1977 album &quot;Exodus&quot;.&quot;Exodus&quot; peaked at #20 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart, and #15 on the Black Albums chart as well as remaining in the UK charts for 56 consecutive weeks where it peaked at #8.&quot;Exodus&quot; has been recognized by music critics as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 1999, Time magazine named Exodus the best album of the 20th century. In 2001, the TV network VH1 named it the 26th greatest album of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 169 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n&quot;Easy Skanking&quot; is a song written by Bob Marley and released in 1978 on the album &quot;Kaja&quot;.It was a roots reggae album.The album has a very relaxed, laid back sound, lacking much of the militant quality of the Wailers lyrically and musically. They received criticism for 'going soft' as a result of the general sound of the album as well as the theme: songs primarily revolving around love, as well as marijuana. Well known songs from the album include &quot;Is This Love&quot; and &quot;Sun Is Shining&quot;. Kaya reached the top five in the UK album charts. \n&quot;Now That We Found Love&quot; was written by Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff and originally recorded by The O'Jays. Cover version have been an album track by Martha Reeves. In 1978, the Jamaican group Third World recorded the song in a more uptempo style with a Funk bassline, leaving off the strings from the original version.The single was released in 1978 by Island Records and peaked at #47 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nIn 1991, Heavy D &amp; the Boyz pumped the bass even more on their Rap version, which hit #11 in the US and #2 in the UK.\n\n\n\n08.11. SKA, ROCKSTADY AND REGGAE\n\nSka arose in the studios of Jamaica around 1959; it developed from the earlier mento genre. Ska is characterized by a walking bass line, accentuated guitar or piano rhythms on the offbeat, and sometimes jazz-like horn riffs.\n\nRocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor to ska, and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals and The Paragons. \nRocksteady uses some of the sound elements of rhythm and blues and ska but it is slower and more relaxed than ska. Rocksteady arose at a time when young people from the Jamaican countryside were flooding into the urban ghettos of Kingston ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in neighborhoods such as Riverton City, Greenwich Town and Trenchtown. Many of them became delinquents who exuded a certain coolness and style. These unruly youths became known as rude boys.\nReggae as a musical term first appeared in print with the 1968 rocksteady hit &quot;Do the Reggay&quot; by The Maytals, but it was already being used in Kingston, Jamaica as the name of a slower dance and style of rocksteady. By the late 1960s, the Rastafari movement became more popular in Jamaica and rocksteady became less popular. \nThe Wailers, a band started by Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer are perhaps the most recognised band that made the transition through all three stages of early Jamaican popular music: ska, rocksteady and reggae. Other significant reggae pioneers include Prince Buster, Desmond Dekker and Jackie Mittoo. \n\nRoots reggae is a subgenre of reggae that deals with the everyday lives and aspirations of the artists concerned, including the spiritual side of Rastafari and with the honoring of their God, Jah. It also is identified with the life of the ghetto sufferer, and the rural poor. Lyrical themes include spirituality and religion, poverty, Black pride, social issues, resistance to government and racial oppression, and repatriation to Africa. The heyday of roots reggae is usually considered the latter half of the 1970s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with singers such as Johnny Clarke, Cornell Campbell, Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Burning Spear, Max Romeo, Horace Andy, Hugh Mundell, and Lincoln Thompson, and groups like Black Uhuru, Steel Pulse, Israel Vibration, The Gladiators and Culture\n\n\nBOB MARLEY - Concrete Jungle (1973)\nBOB MARLEY - Lively Up Yourself (1975)\nTHE ABYSSINIANS - Declaration of Rights (1975)\nBURNING SPEAR - Man In The Hills (1976)\nBOB MARLEY - Three Little Birds (1977) \nBOB MARLEY - Keep On Movin (1977)\nPETER TOSH - Legalise It (1977) \nPETER TOSH - Get Up Stend Up (1977)\nALTHEA &amp; DONNA - Uptown Top RankinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (1977) \nHORACE ANDY - Do You Love My Music (1977)\nBOB MARLEY - Easy Skanking (1978) \nTHIRD WORLD - Now That We Found Love (1978)\nJUDY MOWAT - Black Woman (1980)\nBOB MARLEY - Buffalo Soldier (1980)\nPETER TOSH - Johnny.B.Goode (1983)\nCORNELL CAMPBELL - Money (1983)\nPETER TOSH - JOHNNY B.

By the mid 1970s, reggae was getting radio play in the UK on John Peel's radio show, and Peel continued to play reggae on his show throughout his career. Reggae began to enjoy a revival in the UK that continued into the 1980s, exemplified by groups like Steel Pulse, Aswad, UB40, and Musical Youth. Other reggae artists who enjoyed international appeal in the early 1980s include Third World, Black Uhuru and Sugar Minott.\n\n\nERIC CLAPTON - I Shot the Sheriff (1974)\nUB 40 - One In Ten (1981)\nASWAD - Dont Turn Around (1988)\nASWAD - Best of My Love (1990)\nASWAD - Smile (1990)\nASWAD - Shine (1994)\nASWAD - What Is Love (2009)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74c24615b2e2928d20285370ab5cd14114c83f43","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+358","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74c24615b2e2928d20285370ab5cd14114c83f43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,194,70,21,178,226,146,141,32,40,83,112,171,92,209,65,20,200,63,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
