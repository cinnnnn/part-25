It is a book for free reading. It is\n    designed for a reader with some knowledge of algebra, even\n    though half mastered and perhaps half forgotten. The\n    present text hopes to help the reader recall such haphazard\n    knowledge and polish it up, the aim being to fix certain\n    facts in his mind. It is meant to develop in the reader a\n    taste for algebra and problem-solving, and also excite him\n    to dip into algebra textbooks and fill in the blanks in his\n    knowledge.\n\n    To make the subject more attractive I have made use of\n    a variety of tools: problems with intriguing plots to excite\n    the reader's curiosity, amusing excursions into the history\n    of mathematics, unexpected uses that algebra is put to in\n    everyday affairs, and more.\n\nThis particular edition was edited and supplemented by V. G. Boltyansky and translated from the thirteenth Russian edition by George Yankovsky and was published by Mir in 1979.\n\nDJVU | 1 MB | Cover | 234 pp\n\nAll credits to the original uploader.\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\t\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\nFrom the Author's Preface to\nthe Third Edition 5\nChapter I.
