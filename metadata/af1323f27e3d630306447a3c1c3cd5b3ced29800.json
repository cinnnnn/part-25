Those affected have complained of Gmail compatibility issues and erratic Smart Mailbox behavior.\n\nIn addition to Mail and Messages, Apple requests developers test server message block (SMB2), graphics drivers, VoiceOver and VPN services. Apple switched from AFP file sharing to SMB2 with Mavericks in an effort to enhance performance, security and cross-platform compatibility.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af1323f27e3d630306447a3c1c3cd5b3ced29800","amp;dn":"OS+X+Mavericks+10.9.2+Build+13C48","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af1323f27e3d630306447a3c1c3cd5b3ced29800","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,19,35,242,126,61,99,3,6,68,122,60,28,60,213,179,206,210,152,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
