It is considered by many to be Kenner's masterpiece, and is generally seen as a seminal text on not only Ezra Pound but Modernism in general. As the title suggests, it places Ezra Pound at the center of the Modernist movement in literature and art during the early 20th Century.\nKenner played an influential role in raising Ezra Pound's profile among critics and other readers of poetry. The Pound Era, the product of years of scholarship, was published in 1971. This work was responsible for enshrining Pound's reputation (damaged by his wartime activities) as one of the greatest Modernists.\nPart biography, part intellectual history and part literary criticism, The Pound Era is a singular work, and one of the most important analyses of the Modernist period.\nOne major criticism of the book[who?] is that within its near-600 pages, it never adequately takes on the question of Pound's antisemitism.\n\n(Sorry for Poor Print!!!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:807672b09e8183e64786a14a2a232e9544e2c1a2","amp;dn":"Hugh+Kenner%3A+The+Pound+Era","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"807672b09e8183e64786a14a2a232e9544e2c1a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,118,114,176,158,129,131,230,71,134,161,74,42,35,46,149,68,226,193,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
