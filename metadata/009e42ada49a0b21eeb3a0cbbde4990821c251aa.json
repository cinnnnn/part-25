His mallets have been featured in recordings by Josh\nBerman, Jason Ajemian, Harris Eisenstadt, the Lucky 7s, and Rob Mazurek's\nExploding Star Orchestra.\n\nAs a leader, his two recordings with Rolldown, the self-titled 2008 disc on 482\nMusic and Varmint (Cuneiform, 2009) feature Josh Berman, Aram Shelton, Jason\nRoebke, and Frank Rosaly playing his original compositions. Here, he pares\nthings down to a simple trio with bassist Nate McBride (Joe Morris, Ken\nVandermark) and Mike Reed, with whom Adasiewicz collaborates in the drummer's\nPeople, Places &amp; Things.\n\nWith Sun Rooms, he delivers his version of a piano trio, with five original\npieces and three &quot;sort of&quot; standards. Perhaps it is easiest to begin with those\npieces, as a gauge of the trio's playing. They play Duke Ellington's &quot;Warm\nValley&quot; straight, with McBride leading the melody before playing an overtly\nsimple statement, like humming a favorite tune. Sun Ra's &quot;Overtones Of China,&quot;\nis performed with amped-up forcefulness, McBride and Reed supplying the\ncompulsion, as Adasiewicz applies ringing, simple notes. Like Thelonious Monk or\nMiles Davis, Reed can say more with economy of sound then a noisy solo. &quot;Off My\nBack&quot; by Hasdaan Ibn AliÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a favorite of Max Roach in the 1960sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½comes closest to\nAdasiewicz's style. The piece, which opens with the trio producing what might be\nmistaken for a bit of electronics hum, features a sly mercurial swing that is\nsimultaneously unadorned and knotty.\n\nThe remaining five tracks, all originals, are invigorated by the players. &quot;Life&quot;\nalmost prances on the melody before the momentum is slowed with McBride's\nsolo. The vibraphone, like the bass clarinet, can be pushed to extremes, yet\nnever sounds bellicose or threatening. This trio can swing hard, yet the music\nremains a warming wash of tones and resonances. Adasiewicz' &quot;Stake&quot; is played\nfast and hard, with Reed's snare drum and ride cymbal chasing the fleet\nmallets. Next comes the balladic &quot;Rose Garden,&quot; with its cascading\nnotesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½something that might have been written with the great Bobby Hutcherson in\nmind.\n\nThis disc should be kept in mind when 2010's 'best of' lists are written.\n\n--\n\nBy Nic Jones &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=38217&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=38217&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Matthew Wuethrich &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/6126&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/6126&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Areif Sless-Kitain &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://timeoutchicago.com/music-nightlife/music/91188/jason-adasiewicz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://timeoutchicago.com/music-nightlife/music/91188/jason-adasiewicz&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Lloyd Sachs &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://jazztimes.com/articles/27218-sun-rooms-jason-adasiewicz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://jazztimes.com/articles/27218-sun-rooms-jason-adasiewicz&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor Cayetano LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³pez\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:009e42ada49a0b21eeb3a0cbbde4990821c251aa","amp;dn":"Jason+Adasiewicz+-+Sun+Rooms+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"009e42ada49a0b21eeb3a0cbbde4990821c251aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,158,66,173,164,154,11,33,238,179,160,203,189,228,153,8,33,194,81,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
