Their breakthrough release came with 1994Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Wasted Youth Club Classics, a collision of breakbeats with disparate samples and trip-hop inspired Ã¢â‚¬ËœothernessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Part of the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ethos was a rebuttal of the way the modern club scene had evolved, and the expensive ticket prices charged by name DJs. The bleak but realistic mood of the album was further explored with the release of the attendant 10-inch single, Ã¢â‚¬ËœStone Island EstateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Cavanagh also works as an underground music journalist, scriptwriter and a club promoter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8724a2dc602ac601a1d6fefe2818656cd5efc74","amp;dn":"Glamorous+Hooligan+-+Naked+City+Soundtrax+%5B1998%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8724a2dc602ac601a1d6fefe2818656cd5efc74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,114,74,45,198,2,172,96,26,29,111,239,226,129,134,86,205,94,252,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
