A global sensation, the album garnered several hit singles and sold millions of copies worldwide. It also faired pretty well with critics, who appreciated the band's mix of melodic songcraft and catchy, dance-oriented material that, while slickly produced, avoided the commercial cynicism and adult contemporary posturing of some of their '80s and '90s forebears. Rather than mess with a good thing, One Direction stick with this formula on the band's sophomore effort, 2012's Take Me Home. Once again working largely with Sweden's Carl Falk, Rami Yacoub, and Savan Kotecha, who produced Up All Night, One Direction deliver another immediately catchy mix of dancey pop that maximizes the group's shared lead-vocal approach and peppy, upbeat image. This album highlights even more than their previous one how much One Direction's mix of punchy guitars over snappy beats, handclaps, and bright synthesizers has in common with the positive, fun-loving tone of '70s bubblegum pop, as well as more contemporary bands like the Jonas Brothers and perennial guilty pleasure Hanson. Also added to the mix this time around are two songs (&quot;Little Things&quot; and &quot;Over Again&quot;) co-written by British singer/songwriter Ed Sheeran, whose intimate folk-R&amp;B aesthetic lends an air of maturity to One Direction's admittedly squeaky-fresh sound. The boys of One Direction also nab a few co-writing credits here, as does McFly's Tom Fletcher, whose contribution &quot;I Would,&quot; a kind of in-spirit sequel to his Up All Night contribution &quot;I Want,&quot; stands out as a considerably smart and infectious cut. Ultimately, tracks like the frenetically hyper &quot;Kiss You&quot; and the soundtrack-ready &quot;Back for You&quot; will, as with the rest of Take Me Home, certainly appeal to the group's rabid teen followers, and might even end up on their parents' playlist, too. [The Deluxe Yearbook Edition contains four extra tracks and an exclusive booklet with personal pictures of the band and interviews.]\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nArtist: One Direction\nAlbum: Take Me Home: Yearbook Edition (Album + Music Video + LP)\nFormat: iTunes m4a\nOverall bit rate mode: Constant\nOverall bit rate: 320 Kbps\nArtist : One Direction\nTotal Tracks: 21 (17 tracks + 4 Videos)\nVideo Format: iTunes m4v\nCover: Yes\nCover Type: Front\nGenre:  Pop, Music, Teen Pop, Dance, Pop/Rock, Rock, World\nRelease date: November 09, 2012\nSource:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/nz/album/take-me-home-yearbook-edition/id574406654&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/nz/album/take-me-home-yearbook-edition/id574406654&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor Album Art ::  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/ff7201f31ed80b9d2a110d2ab20b86361f4f996a.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/ff7201f31ed80b9d2a110d2ab20b86361f4f996a.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nProof :: //bayimg.com/aaNoOaAEg\n\nTracklist:::\n\n01 Live While WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Young\n02 Kiss You\n03 Little Things\n04 CÃ¢â‚¬â„¢mon, CÃ¢â‚¬â„¢mon\n05 Last First Kiss\n06 Heart Attack\n07 Rock Me\n08 Change My Mind\n09 I Would\n10 Over Again\n11 Back For You\n12 They DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Know About Us\n13 Summer Love\n14 SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Not Afraid\n15 Loved You First\n16 Nobody Compares\n17 Still the One\n18 One Thing (Video)\n19 What Makes You Beautiful (Video)\n20 Moments (Video)\n21 Backstage At the iTunes Festival 2012 (Video)\n+ Take Me Home : Yearbook Edition Ã¢â‚¬â€œ iTunes LP\n\n\n\nPlease support the artist!\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nNOTE :: iTunes LP is only for use on a Mac or PC with iTunes 9 or later, or on Apple TV version 3.0 or later.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nAs I AM NEW HERE!!
