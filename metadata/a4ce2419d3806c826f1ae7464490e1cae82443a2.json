Sims' tart, alternately lush and furious solos were wonderfully spotlighted on such tunes as &quot;Cinnamon and Cloves,&quot; &quot;Emily&quot; and &quot;Zoot.&quot; The six-tune session, recently issued on CD, also contains effective piano solos from Mike Wofford. The date's tour-de-force was its final selection, the wonderful &quot;Low Life,&quot; which Sims probed, illuminated and ultimately redefined via his solo. \n\nZoot Sims - Tenor\nMike Wofford - Piano\nChuck Berghofer - Bass\nNick Ceroli - Drums\nVictor Feldman - Percussion\n\n01.
