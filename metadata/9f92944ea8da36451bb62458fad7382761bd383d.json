Riddled with illness that affects her full body especially her face, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been sneered at, endured meth jokes, and asked what grade of weed made her eyes so bloodshot. Growing sick of it, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d covered herself from head to toe and donned the shades. \n\nRich is shy but loves a challenge. His family has been successful within the health food industry, but he has yet to make a name for himself. Fierce competition alongside witnessing the arrogance of his brother has worn him down. But when he saw Candice, he sees her silvery eyes and a golden opportunity. \n\nWhen sparks fly, Candice finds herself agreeing to spend some time with Rich, drinking the juice he prepares for her everyday. The old, flawless Candice is starting to resurface, and it feels good to be called beautiful again. But she can't help but think - is his affection for real?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f92944ea8da36451bb62458fad7382761bd383d","amp;dn":"UGLY+-+McBride%2C+Betty.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f92944ea8da36451bb62458fad7382761bd383d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,146,148,78,168,218,54,69,27,182,36,88,250,215,56,39,97,189,56,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
