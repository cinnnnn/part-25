Raised by Kiowa tribesmen, Boytale is now 17 years old and filled with an insatiable thirst for the blood of his people's enemies. Meanwhile, across the prairie at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 20-year-old army private James Rambling gears up for action as an Indian fighter. Henry Strozier provides a dramatic narration of this gritty and authentic tale of the utter savagery of frontier violence","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34b41a202f24e54d0dac16fd715cc4e958830457","amp;dn":"Walter+Lucas-Warrior%27s+Blood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34b41a202f24e54d0dac16fd715cc4e958830457","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,180,26,32,47,36,229,77,13,172,22,253,113,92,196,233,88,131,4,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
