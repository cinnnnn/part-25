So this\r\nyear they're back with several albums, and more to come on this.\r\n\r\nOn this album we find drummer Bart in a fine duo with trumpeter Tomasz\r\nDabrowski, a very talented young musician who has figured in several of our\r\nreviews in the past years, with his own TOM Trio, with 3D and a duo album with\r\ndrummer Tyshawn Sorey.\r\n\r\nAnd what about this one? It's gorgeous and fantastic. It's the kind of music\r\nthat makes you dance on the spot out of sheer joy with what you hear. Bart Oles\r\nis a real wizzard on the drums, full of energy and sophisticated inventiveness,\r\nthe kind of drummer who keeps any listener captivated by what's happening, even\r\nwhen playing solo, and while keeping the core pulse going, he keeps adding\r\nalmost counter-intuitive beats that are nothing less than fascinating.\r\n\r\nDabrowski has an incredible tone and a very creative approach without resorting\r\nto extended techniques. He is also an emotional player, able to drag the\r\nlistener in and taking her on journeys of jubilant joy or more contemplative\r\nsensitivities. Can I say the following? (really, can I say this?) Polish\r\npeople, my apologies, but I once fell asleep during a concert of Tomasz\r\nStanko. I doubt this will ever happen when listening to Tomasz Dabrowski. He's\r\nthat good.\r\n\r\nHave we heard this musical approach before? Yes, of course, and therefore a\r\nfive-star rating may not be appropriate, but on all other aspects, the album\r\nis, as I said, it's really great: intense, captivating, instrumental\r\nmastership, fabulous interaction, authenticiy, inventiveness,\r\near-candy galore ... so don't miss it.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Adam Baruch\r\n\r\nBy Mateusz Magierowski (pl)\r\n\r\nPiotr Wojdat (pl) \nhttp://www.jazzarium.pl/przeczytaj/recenzje/chapters\r\n\r\nPiotr Wickowski (pl) \nhttp://www.jazzpress.pl/publicystyka/26-recenzja/2737-bartlomiej-oles-tomasz-dabrowski-chapters","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9710d1ca01b633bca7fc5c3aaf61c60b12237f95","amp;dn":"Bartlomiej+Oles%2C+Tomasz+Dabrowski+-+Chapters+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9710d1ca01b633bca7fc5c3aaf61c60b12237f95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,16,209,202,1,182,51,188,167,252,92,58,175,97,198,11,18,35,127,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
