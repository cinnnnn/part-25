Since that time, this publication has been used nationally and internationally in a number of colleges of osteopathic medicine,\nchiropractic colleges, schools of physical therapy, and schools of massage therapy.\n\nAs a second year Family Medicine/Neuromusculoskeletal Medicine Resident, I had the privilege to shadow and treat patients with Dr Greenman in his clinic at Michigan State University. It was during these precious moments in his clinic when I began to recognize my role in facilitating oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s process toward improved function; this is the goal of the osteopathic manipulative\nmedicine treatment.\n\nThe fourth edition of GreenmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Principles of Manual Medicine attempts to help the reader look beyond the general application and pursue the Ã¢â‚¬Å“howÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“whyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ technique can improve neuromusculoskeletal system function. The basic principles\nare maintained and substantially referenced thanks in part to two major scientific contributors to our understanding of manual medicineÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe First International Fascia Conference and Movement Stability &amp; Low Back Pain: The Essential Role of the Pelvis, which originated out of two world congresses on low back and pelvic pain.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bec1eafbae2ddcb2a1a892a014f9581f22a56e29","amp;dn":"DeStefano+2011+Greenman%27s+Principles+of+Manual+Medicine+4th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bec1eafbae2ddcb2a1a892a014f9581f22a56e29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,193,234,251,174,45,220,178,161,168,146,160,20,249,88,31,34,165,110,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
