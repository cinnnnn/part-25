Screaming &quot;It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll),&quot; singer Bon Scott teased like a braggart. Sensing the rock community's growing dissatisfaction with bloated, epic-scaled bands, AC/DC were indeed a high-voltage act: their drummer nailed the beat with fury, their bluesy guitar riffs mutated into something metallic and sharp-edged, and Scott's vocals took the shrillness of early Robert Plant to a leaner and meaner place. &quot;Live Wire&quot; is one of the most electrifying hard rock songs imaginable, &quot;High Voltage&quot; and &quot;TNT&quot; are the musical equivalent of touching exposed nerves with a rusty fork, and &quot;Jack&quot; proves that white rock dudes can, contrary to popular belief, get down.
