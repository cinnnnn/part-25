Choose your starting abilities\ncarefully, because they and your wit are the only tools you have in\nthe apocalypse!\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bluebottlegames.com/main/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bluebottlegames.com/main/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInstructions:\n1) Unzip\n2) Enjoy!\n\nIt's DRM-Free as far as I know, however I would block it on your firewall anyway.\n\nHope you all enjoy this game!
