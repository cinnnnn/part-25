Don't worry, though.  I took care of it.\nTrack 5 was actually the 1st track.  \nI've placed the tracks in what I believe to be the proper order. \nI've also removed gaps and applied a small fade.  No EQ or added noise reduction.  It already sounds like there's a ton of it.\n\nThis has previously been (and, unfortunately, it will also continue to be) shared by many collectors for years in a bit of an incorrect state.  However, it was that state that got it to THIS state.  So let's not discount its value in the lineage.  But hopefully, this one will have a life through reseeds.  I place it in your hands.  \n\nNow, I can give a little bit back with this significant pitch-corrected, remastered upgrade.  \n\nEnjoy!\n\nYer PervFesser","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d019d576b12c995cf616febcf2127bfbb3e29471","amp;dn":"bill+evans+seattle+1966","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d019d576b12c995cf616febcf2127bfbb3e29471","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,25,213,118,177,44,153,92,246,22,254,188,242,18,123,251,179,226,148,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
