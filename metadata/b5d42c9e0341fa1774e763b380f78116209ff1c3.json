Again. Even  more  than  there  were  last      \n         time: they seem to  materialize  out  of  the  very      \n         grains of the  radioactive  desert  sand.  Venomous      \n         yellow eyes. The black gunmetal glint  of  Uzis  as      \n         they close in for the kill. There's nowhere to run,      \n         and nothing to rely on but your MAC 17 machine gun.      \n         What a way to save the  human  race.  The  year  is      \n         2087, eighty-nine years after an  all  out  nuclear      \n         war between the United States and the Soviet  Union      \n         turned vast swaths of  the  Earth  into  a  hellish      \n         wasteland  where  survival  is  a  daily   struggle      \n         against   thirst,   hunger,   radiation   sickness,      \n         ravaging raiders, and mutants - always mutants. You      \n         are a Desert Ranger, one  of  a  band  of  stalwart      \n         lawmen born  from  the  remnants  of  a  U.S.  Army      \n         detachment who survived the  nuclear  holocaust  by      \n         holing up in a maximum  security  prison.  You  may      \n         wear ragtag uniforms and carry make-shift  weapons,      \n         but the Desert Rangers are the  only  law  left  in      \n         what was once the American southwest. Now something      \n         more secretive and sinister than the  usual  roving      \n         bands of mutants and raiders is menacing  humanity,      \n         and it's your job to investigate. Recruit the  help      \n         you need, follow any leads you  find,  but  beware.      \n         The wasteland is lawless desert and a lonely place,      \n         and the choices  you  make  will  shape  the  world      \n         around you. Better choose wisely. Your life depends      \n         on it.                                                   \n\n         1- Unpack, burn or mount                                 \n         2- Install the game                                      \n         3- Go To Hell!                                           \n                                                                  \n         NOTE:                                                    \n         This version features  toggle-able  modern  updates      \n         such as new paragraph voice over, new music  tracks      \n         and updated portraits.                                   \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5d42c9e0341fa1774e763b380f78116209ff1c3","amp;dn":"Wasteland.The.Original.Classic-PROPHET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5d42c9e0341fa1774e763b380f78116209ff1c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,212,44,158,3,65,250,23,116,231,99,179,128,247,129,22,32,159,241,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
