Presented in a colourful, reader-friendly way with over 400 detailed illustrations, the text presents a succinct account of the subject, starting with the basic science and then moving through clinical manifestations, diagnostic techniques, treatment and clinical management of the most common skin disorders. Concise text, key point boxes and chapter summaries will help medical students with their all-important exam revision. More comprehensive, and written at a modern diagnostic level with techniques and surgical treatments, the book retains all the features that have made previous editions so successful: numerous colour illustrations, clear down to earth style, rapid access to information, real-life case studies and invaluable chapter summaries.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a217e76bf78d964635b8d5fd2cc47dbd3b0d936","amp;dn":"Roxburgh%27s+Common+Skin+Diseases+18th+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a217e76bf78d964635b8d5fd2cc47dbd3b0d936","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,33,126,118,191,120,217,100,99,91,141,95,210,204,71,219,211,176,217,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
