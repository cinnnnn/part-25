The songs included within are not necessarily their favorite songs, but rather songs that both compliment the genre diversity goal of this mixtape, as well as songs that might not necessarily get any radio airtime based upon their popularity.  Its intended purpose was to stay true to the assorted variety we were trying to achieve, while introducing me (and others) to Christian Music we might not otherwise experience.\n\nThat said, I would like to thank everyone for their 3 song recommendations.  Originally I was only going to include the first 2 songs of those recommendations, while only visiting the third song if/when I didn't have access to one of the first 2 songs.  But since I didn't get quite as much participation as I had hoped and anticipated, and since I had every song except one (sorry Nathan.S, I couldn't find Wes King's &quot;Staring Down The Dog&quot; anywhere in my collection), I went ahead and included all 3 recommendations from everyone I received feedback from.\n\nThis disc will now find a semi-permanent home in my vehicle's stereo.  And without yet listening to the entire mixtape, I can already tell that I'll be adding some new music to my disc changer such as some new Christifari (which I haven't listened to since 1999), some Sounds Of Salvation and Soulfire Revolution (which I've not heard before today), some Bizzle, and some Lost Dogs - All of which made a great first impression on me already.\n\nThanks again Guys.\n\nGlory To God,\nTorrentTracts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ November 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d027ac03cedbc7ab0fea35dafbf6ea37b8f7ddcc","amp;dn":"Various+-+2013+-+Piratebay+Christian+Music+Mixtape%2C+Vol+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d027ac03cedbc7ab0fea35dafbf6ea37b8f7ddcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,39,172,3,206,219,199,171,15,234,53,218,251,246,234,55,184,247,221,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
