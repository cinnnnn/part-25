The strength of the collection is the wonderful orchestrations in the early Baobab songs (tracks 1-7), with many of the musicians that Baobab fans love to hear (like Medoune Diallo, N'Diouga Dieng, Mountaga KouyatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Charly N'Diaye and Issa Cissokho). The swing is relaxed, the feeling one of early evening in a bar, a single couple sweetly tracing the floor. The melodies are lovely; the compositions stir moments of joy, melancholy, reverance and romance. The arrangements highlight Atisso's exquisite touch and timing and the slurry soulfulness of Cissokho's sax. Above all, the voices of Gomis and SidibÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© (primarily the former) are subtle, passionate and blend beautifully.\n\n\n1.\tMansane Cisse\n2.\tMansane Cisse\n3.\tSutukum\n4.\tCabral \t\n5.\tDigone Nga Ma\t\n6.\tSindieli \n7.\tSona \n8.\tToon Baaxul \n9.\tSaxaar \t\n10.\tKura \n11.\tTante Marie \n12.\tNotise \t\n\n Art work included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:945e5ee36f42ae961a5331eb734253a8a2c61588","amp;dn":"Orchestre+Baobab+Roots+And+fruits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"945e5ee36f42ae961a5331eb734253a8a2c61588","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,94,94,227,111,66,174,150,26,83,49,235,115,66,83,168,162,198,21,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
