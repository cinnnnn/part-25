RENEWED. RESURRECTED. With new enemies, new friends and that same old 'grinnin' in the face of hell' attitude, the Man Without Fear is back and leading with his face! Mark Waid (AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, Irredeemable, RUSE) joins neo-legendary artists Paolo Rivera and Marcos Martin for a new, Eisner Award-winning spin on Daredevil that will leave you gasping for air. Having turned his world upside over the past several years, Matt Murdock realizes justice may not be blind to his past - and villains may not be the only ones looking for answers. Klaw, master of sound. The Megacrime cartel. Mole Man. The Black Cat. Bring it on! If Matt Murdock could see what he was doing...he'd be terrified. Collecting DAREDEVIL #1-10 and 10.1, and AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #677.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6367cd89673e2585f0d1b51c8290f85da7982bb1","amp;dn":"Daredevil+By+Mark+Waid+v1+%282012%29+%28Digital+TPB%29+%28UberSoldier-DCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6367cd89673e2585f0d1b51c8290f85da7982bb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,103,205,137,103,62,37,133,240,209,181,28,130,144,248,93,167,152,43,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
