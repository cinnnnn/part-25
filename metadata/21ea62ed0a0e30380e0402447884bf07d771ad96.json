Hyman and Bazilian first teamed in the group Baby Grand, which also included future producer Rick Chertoff; after a pair of LPs for Arista, the band dissolved in 1978, with the Hooters forming soon after. Also including guitarist John Lilley, bassist Rob Miller, and drummer David Uosikkinen, the group honed an eclectic blend of rock, folk, and ska, taking their name from the melodica, or &quot;hooter,&quot; which lent their sound its distinctive edge; while the Hooters earned a devoted cult following at home in Philadelphia, Hyman and Bazilian also enjoyed busy careers as composers and session players, most notably contributing extensively to Cyndi Lauper's 1983 blockbuster She's So Unusual. The album was produced by Chertoff, who co-wrote the oft-covered ballad &quot;Time After Time&quot; with Hyman.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-hooters-p4510/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-hooters-p4510/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/out-of-body-r178842&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/out-of-body-r178842&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000008GN3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000008GN3&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
