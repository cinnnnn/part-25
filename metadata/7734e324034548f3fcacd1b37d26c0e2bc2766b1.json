It is very much a jam session set, with &quot;Salt And Pepper&quot; being a heated medium-tempo blues and the two competitive tenors stretching out on &quot;S'posin'&quot; and a lengthy &quot;Perdido.&quot; The most memorable selection from the date is the one on which Stitt switches to alto, &quot;Stardust.&quot; His beautiful playing behind Gonsalves' warm melody statement raises the session to the classic level. \nHighly recommended to bebop and straight-ahead jazz fans.\n\nTracklist: \n01. Salt And Pepper (7:55) \n02. S'Posin' (6:23) \n03. Theme From Lord Of The Flies (2:28 ) \n04. Perdido (12:43) \n05.
