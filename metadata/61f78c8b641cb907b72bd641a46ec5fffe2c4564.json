Whitehead and Michael Wesch\nUniversity Press of Colorado | August 2012 | ISBN-10: 1607321890 | ePUB | 288 pages | 16.9 mb\n\nTurning an anthropological eye toward cyberspace, Human No More explores how conditions of the online world shape identity, place, culture, and death within virtual communities.\nOnline worlds have recently thrown into question the traditional anthropological conception of place-based ethnography. They break definitions, blur distinctions, and force us to rethink the notion of the &quot;subject.&quot; Human No More asks how digital cultures can be integrated and how the ethnography of both the &quot;unhuman&quot; and the &quot;digital&quot; could lead to possible reconfiguring the notion of the &quot;human.&quot;\nThis provocative and groundbreaking work challenges fundamental assumptions about the entire field of anthropology. Cross-disciplinary research from well-respected contributors makes this volume vital to the understanding of contemporary human interaction. It will be of interest not only to anthropologists but also to students and scholars of media, communication, popular culture, identity, and technology.\n\nAbout the Authors\nNeil L. Whitehead is a professor of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nMichael Wesch is an associate professor of cultural anthropology at Kansas State University.\n\nCONTENTS       \nIntroduction: Human No More - Neil L.
