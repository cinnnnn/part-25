As a result, the band attacked their second album, Accident &amp; Emergency, with everything they have, tearing free of their glammed-up punk roots in the process. Each song has a nervy, punky riff as a foundation, which the band uses as a launching pad for invigorating inflections like strangled, screaming processed guitars, doomy atmospherics and folky Spanish guitars. At its core, Accident &amp; Emergency remains punky glam, but These Animal Men are no longer indebted to their influences and the result is a vigorous, exciting record teeming with noise and hooks, which (Come On, Join) The High Society never suggested the group to be capable of delivering. (4.5/5)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d9a6e768266c959e7ce2c9f3e483e5edffc99d4","amp;dn":"These+Animal+Men+-+Accident+%26amp%3B+Emergency+%5B1997%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d9a6e768266c959e7ce2c9f3e483e5edffc99d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,154,110,118,130,102,201,89,231,206,44,159,62,72,62,94,223,252,153,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
