The color effect was a little faded,\nat least with this, the only surviving film print of any of the CBS shows.\n\nGracie Allen was said to be nervous about being on color film, because she\nsupposedly had to have different color eyeballs. I think that's hard to tell!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:205820defd463475c8031d8f729ea98a39d40888","amp;dn":"GEORGE+BURNS+and+GRACIE+ALLEN+SHOW+%28+--+filmed+in+color+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"205820defd463475c8031d8f729ea98a39d40888","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,88,32,222,253,70,52,117,200,3,29,143,114,158,169,138,57,212,8,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
