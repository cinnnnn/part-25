Regardless of the plot, the quality of the stop-motion is very nice and the film is fun. As for the story, a young black kid is taking a pie to the Deacon's house and the wily scarecrow wants to get that pie--even if it means scaring the wits out of poor Jasper.\n\n\nDirector:\nGeorge Pal\nStars:\nRex Ingram, Victor Jory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fc5692b4a7ec30ad95fe11f40e73a8916f4aee6","amp;dn":"Jasper+and+the+Haunted+House+%281942%29%28flv%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fc5692b4a7ec30ad95fe11f40e73a8916f4aee6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,197,105,43,74,126,195,10,217,95,225,31,64,231,58,137,22,244,174,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
