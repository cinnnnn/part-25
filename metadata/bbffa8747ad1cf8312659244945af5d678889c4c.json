Bond and Eve chase the killer, mercenary Patrice, and attempt to recover the disk. During the chase, Bond is shot in the shoulder. While fighting Patrice, Bond is accidentally shot by Eve and is later considered &quot;missing, presumed killed&quot;.\n\nThe head of MI6, M, comes under political pressure to retire during a meeting with the Intelligence and Security Committee Chairman, Gareth Mallory. On her return from the meeting, MI6 is hacked and an explosion occurs in the offices, killing eight MI6 employees. Bond, having used his supposed death to retire, learns of the attack and returns to London. Shrapnel taken from his earlier shoulder wound helps identify Patrice, and Bond tracks the mercenary to Shanghai.\n\nMeanwhile, three NATO agents are killed after their identities are exposed, and further releases are threatened. After Patrice assassinates a target, he and Bond fight. Patrice falls to his death before Bond can learn of his employer. Searching Patrice's equipment, Bond finds a gambling chip which leads him to a casino in Macau. SÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©rine, who Bond saw earlier during the assassination, warns him that he is about to be killed, but promises to help him if he will kill her employer. Bond beats his attackers and joins SÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©rine on her boat. They travel to an island, where they are taken prisoner by the crew and delivered to SÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©rine's employer, Raoul Silva. A former MI6 agent working under M, Silva holds her responsible for his torture and imprisonment by the Chinese. Silva kills SÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©rine, but Bond overpowers his guards and captures Silva for extraction to the UK.\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbffa8747ad1cf8312659244945af5d678889c4c","amp;dn":"SKYFALL+Xvidcam+GLOBE.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbffa8747ad1cf8312659244945af5d678889c4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,255,168,116,122,209,207,131,18,101,146,68,148,90,245,214,120,136,156,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
