Before quitting, Joe agreed to one last job, little realizing that the man he'd been sent to kill was deeply involved in demonlogy. He survived Joe's attempt and came after him, fatally wounding Joe and killing Laura. As he lay dying, an angelic force (who may or may not be what she appears) pointed out that where she is going, he can't follow, and where he is going, he wouldn't want her to follow.\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - Star Wars - Obsession (#001-005) [2004-2005]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9034337&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9034337&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&amp;\n\nStar Wars - Infinities (#001-012) [2001-2003]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9034327&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9034327&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music)] - State of Decay OST (2013) - Jesper Kyd:\n                  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you have any questions please feel free to ask! ** ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ddd995560fb454ae64b84cbab2720f76543bdb9","amp;dn":"Ten+Grand+%28001-004%29+%7C+%28J.+Michael+Straczynski%29+%5BOngoing%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ddd995560fb454ae64b84cbab2720f76543bdb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,221,153,85,96,251,69,74,230,75,132,203,171,39,32,247,101,67,189,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
