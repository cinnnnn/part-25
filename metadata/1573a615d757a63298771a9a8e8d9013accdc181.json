They devoted their March 16, 2012 episode - #460, &quot;Retraction&quot; - to an examination of the errors in the original episode, including an interview with Daisey in which they confronted him about his fabrications.\n\nInstead of relying on their &quot;Retraction&quot; episode to correct the record, or appending corrections to their original episode, This American Life chose to delete the original broadcast in its entirety. They deleted the downloadable mp3 file of the episode from their website, deleted it from their streaming service, and deleted it from iTunes. According to PRI, they also intended to delete it from their Amazon store. However, as of March 18, 2012, the episode was still available for purchase at Amazon for 99 cents. No word on whether the episode will be included in their 2012 greatest hits CD.\n\nFile contents:\n\n- This American Life 454, Mr. Daisey and the Apple Factory, file retrieved 2012-03-18.mp3\n- This American Life 460, Retraction, file retrieved 2012-03-18.mp3\n- Mike Daisey, Modified Stage Show Prologue, published and file retrieved 2012-03-18.mp3\n\n- This American Life 454, Mr. Daisy and the Apple Factory, Transcript, text retrieved 2012-03-18.pdf\n- This American Life 460, Retraction, Transcript, file retrieved 2012-03-18.pdf\n- Mike Daisey, The Agony and Ecstasy of Steve Jobs, Stage Show Monologue, file retrieved 2012-03-18.pdf\n\n- Context and Links, This American Life Deletes Audio File.txt\n\n\n***********************\nIf you're trying to disinter deleted info, publicly tweet about it to @DisinterredInfo\nMaybe *someone* will see your message, disinter the info, republish it somewhere, and tweet a link to it... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://disinterred.info&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://disinterred.info&lt;/a&gt;\n***********************\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1573a615d757a63298771a9a8e8d9013accdc181","amp;dn":"This+American+Life+Epsiodes+454+and+460%2C+on+Mike+Daisey+and+Appl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1573a615d757a63298771a9a8e8d9013accdc181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,115,166,21,215,87,166,50,152,119,26,154,142,141,144,19,172,205,193,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
