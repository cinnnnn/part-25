Run FallOut Mod Manager and activate all the esm files in their respective order of release [url=http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/8629/fommconfig.png]as seen here[/url].\n- In order to run the game, either create a shortcut to the file &quot;fose_loader.exe&quot; which can be found in the main Fallout 3 folder or open up FallOut Mod Manager and click on &quot;Launch FOSE&quot;.\n\n[b]More Info[/b]\nThe ISO, Autorun and the Pack Installer were created by me (SozSurt/Technopath), [u]this torrent does not include Fallout 3 itself, only the DLCs Operation Anchorage, The Pitt and Broken Steel.
