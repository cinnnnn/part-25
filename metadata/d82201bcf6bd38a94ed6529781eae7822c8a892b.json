He is also one of the most contentious and most complex artists of our time. His verbal dexterity ranks him among the greatest technical rappers ever. The content of his songs combines the grotesque and the comical with the sincere and the profound, all told through the sophisticated layering of multiple personae. However one finally assesses his contribution to popular culture, there's no denying his central place in it. This collection of essays gives his work the critical attention it has long deserved. Drawing from history, philosophy, sociology, musicology, and other fields, the writers gathered here consider Eminem's place in Hip Hop, the intellectual underpinnings of his work, and the roles of race, gender and privilege in his career, among various other topics. This original treatment will be appreciated by Eminem fans and cultural scholars alike","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d82201bcf6bd38a94ed6529781eae7822c8a892b","amp;dn":"Eminem+and+Rap%2C+Poetry%2C+Race+Essays+-+Scott+F.+Parker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d82201bcf6bd38a94ed6529781eae7822c8a892b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,34,1,188,246,189,56,169,78,214,82,151,129,234,231,130,44,138,137,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
