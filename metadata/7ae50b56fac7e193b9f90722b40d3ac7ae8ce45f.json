It was released on 27 November 1982. This release was named Talk of the Devil in the UK, that being the more commonly expressed idiom there.\n\nIn the UK, it was the second of four Osbourne albums to attain Silver certification (60,000 units sold) by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving this in January 1983.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1. \t&quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot;   \n2. \t&quot;Snowblind&quot;   \t\n3. \t&quot;Black Sabbath&quot; \n4. \t&quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot;   \t\n5. \t&quot;War Pigs&quot;   \t\n6. \t&quot;The Wizard&quot;  \n7. \t&quot;N.I.B.&quot;   \t\n8. \t&quot;Sweet Leaf&quot;   \t\n9. \t&quot;Never Say Die&quot; \n10. \t&quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;   \t\n11. \t&quot;Iron Man&quot;/&quot;Children of the Grave&quot;   \t\n12. \t&quot;Paranoid&quot;  \n\nThis Is a great album by Ozzy, many people consider it infamous even Ozzy himself. (see the Wikipedia article) But to me it is very good. Is pretty rare and not many people have it. If you like Ozzy you would love this album.
