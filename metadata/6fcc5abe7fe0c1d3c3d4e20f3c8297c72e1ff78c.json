Critics and fans proclaimed them as the new champions of the East Coast Piedmont style of blues, a style of music first popularized by artists like Blind Boy Fuller, Rev. Gary Davis, Blind Willie McTell and Blind Blake.\n\nThis album showcased the emotional depth capable in Cephas' voice, and the original composition 'The Backbiter' is modern acoustic blues at its best.\n\n1.
