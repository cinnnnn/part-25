Abundant applications, many of which use real data, offer students a context for learning the math. The authors use a variety of tools and techniquesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including graphing calculators, multiple approaches to problem solving, and interactive featuresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to engage and motivate all types of learners.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMarvin Bittinger has been teaching math at the university level for more than thirty-eight years. Since 1968, he has been employed at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, and is now professor emeritus of mathematics education. Professor Bittinger has authored over 190 publications on topics ranging from basic mathematics to algebra and trigonometry to applied calculus. He received his BA in mathematics from Manchester College and his PhD in mathematics education from Purdue University. Special honors include Distinguished Visiting Professor at the United States Air Force Academy and his election to the Manchester College Board of Trustees from 1992 to 1999. Professor Bittinger has also had the privilege of speaking at many mathematics conventions, most recently giving a lecture entitled &quot;Baseball and Mathematics.&quot; His hobbies include hiking in Utah, baseball, golf, and bowling. In addition, he also has an interest in philosophy and theology, in particular, apologetics. Professor Bittinger currently lives in Carmel, Indiana with his wife Elaine. He has two grown and married sons, Lowell and Chris, and four granddaughters.\n\n \n\nDavid Ellenbogen has taught math at the college level for nearly 30 years, spending most of that time in the Massachusetts and Vermont community college systems, where he has served on both curriculum and developmental math committees. He has taught at St. Michael's College and The University of Vermont. Professor Ellenbogen has been active in the American Mathematical Association of Two Year Colleges (AMATYC) since 1985, having served on its Developmental Mathematics Committee and as a delegate. He has been a member of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) since 1979. He has authored dozens of texts on topics ranging from prealgebra to calculus and has delivered lectures on the use of language in mathematics. Professor Ellenbogen received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from Bates College and his masterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s degree in community college mathematics education from The University of MassachusettsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Amherst. In his spare time, he enjoys playing piano, biking, hiking, skiing and volunteer work. He currently serves on the boards of the Vermont Sierra Club and the Vermont Bicycle Pedestrian Coalition. He has two sons, Monroe and Zachary.\n\n \n\nBarbara Johnson has a B.S. in mathematics from Bob Jones University and a M.S. in math from Clemson University. She has taught high school and college math for 25 years, and enjoys the challenge of helping each student grow in appreciation for and understanding of mathematics.  As a Purdue Master Gardener, she also enjoys helping others learn gardening skills.  Believing that the best teacher is always learning, she recently earned a black belt in karate.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 1104 pages\n    * Publisher: Addison Wesley; 4 edition (January 6, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0321726340\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0321726346","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a98f9dc5f8bb16bb3c83b84ef5d23fc283f08398","amp;dn":"Elementary+and+Intermed.+Algebra-Graphs%2CModels+4th+Ed%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a98f9dc5f8bb16bb3c83b84ef5d23fc283f08398","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,143,157,197,248,187,22,187,60,131,184,78,245,210,63,194,131,240,131,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
