As Professor Robert Greenberg says, ''If Tchaikovsky felt it, it found a way into his music.''\n\nAs an artist-and it is worth recalling that he was the first full-time, formally trained, professional composer in Russian history-Tchaikovsky walked a fine and difficult line between his Romantic penchant for expression and the demands of Classical structure.\n\nThis delicate balancing act-between heart and head, emotion and reason, release and control, Russian expressive content and German technique-is a key to his music that you find amply illustrated by Professor Greenberg's musical selections and commentary. \n\n8 Lectures\n45 minutes / lecture\n\n1    Introduction and Early Life \n2    A Career in Music \n3    The First Masterworks \n4    Maturity \n5    Three Women-Tatyana, Antonina, and Nadezhda \n6    ''My Great Friend'' \n7    ''A Free Man'' \n8    The Last Years, or Don't Drink the Water \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c1febd6a90157b47ffaa7b95710f349f9a56d12","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Great+Masters+-+Tchaikovsky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c1febd6a90157b47ffaa7b95710f349f9a56d12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,31,235,214,169,1,87,180,127,250,167,185,87,16,243,73,249,165,109,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
