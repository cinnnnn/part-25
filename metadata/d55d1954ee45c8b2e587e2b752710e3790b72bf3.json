Rodi, G. Bergeles (Elsevier, 1996).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0444824634\r\n\r\nThis book presents and discussses new developments in the area of turbulence modelling and measurements, with particular emphasis on engineering-related problems. At present, turbulence is one of the key issues in tackling engineering flow problems. Powerful computers and numerical methods are now available for solving the flow equations, but the simulation of turbulence effects which are nearly always important in practice, is still in an unsatisfactory state and introduces considerable uncertainities in the accuracy of CFD calculations. These and other aspects of turbulence modelling and measurements are dealt with in detail by experts in the field. The resulting book is an up-to-date review of the most recent research in this exciting area","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d55d1954ee45c8b2e587e2b752710e3790b72bf3","amp;dn":"Engineering+Turbulence+Modelling+and+Experiments+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d55d1954ee45c8b2e587e2b752710e3790b72bf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,93,25,84,238,69,200,178,229,135,226,183,82,113,14,55,144,183,43,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
