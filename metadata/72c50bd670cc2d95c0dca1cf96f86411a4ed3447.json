All are sung in an achingly earnest style, which fits with the period, and they're all beguiling in their way -- he overcomes his vocal limitations with sheer sincerity, and also reveals himself a good songwriter, his own &quot;Thoughts of Spring&quot; and &quot;All You've Done for Me&quot; standing well next to Eric Andersen's &quot;Thirsty Boots&quot; and David Blue's &quot;I Like to Sleep Late In the Morning.&quot; One suspects that Seeger (and quite possibly Lee Hayes) might have heard his &quot;Civil War Medley&quot; with the pride an artist has in an admirer emulating his work and style. Additionally, his selection of material has a linear order and momentum that could have made it a good screenplay outline, if anyone had been shooting Civil War stories in 1966. The sound is spare, Burns' six-string joined on some numbers by Emery Fletcher on 12-string.\n\ncd ripped by X Lossless Decoder\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72c50bd670cc2d95c0dca1cf96f86411a4ed3447","amp;dn":"Randy+Burns...Of+Love+And+War%281966%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72c50bd670cc2d95c0dca1cf96f86411a4ed3447","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,197,11,214,112,204,45,149,192,220,161,207,150,248,100,17,164,237,52,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
