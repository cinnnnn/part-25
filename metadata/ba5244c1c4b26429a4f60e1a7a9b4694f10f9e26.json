Wall Street has been saved, but it hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t been reformed. What is the problem?\n\nSuzanne McGee provides a penetrating look at the forces that transformed Wall Street from its traditional role as a capital-generating and economy-boosting engine into a behemoth operating with only its own short-term interests in mind and with reckless disregard for the broader financial system and those who relied on that system for their well being and prosperity.\n\nPrimary among these influences was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoldman Sachs envyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½: the self-delusion on the part of Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers, Stanley OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Neil of Merrill Lynch, and other power brokers (egged on by their shareholders) that taking more risk would enable their companies to make even more money than Goldman Sachs. That hubrisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and that narrow-minded focus on maximizing their short-term profitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½led them to take extraordinary risks that they couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t manage and that later severely damaged, and in some cases destroyed, their businesses, wreaking havoc on the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s economy and millions of 401(k)s in the process.\n\nIn a world that boasted more hedge funds than Taco Bell outlets, McGee demonstrates how it became ever harder for Wall Street to fulfill its function as the financial systemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s version of a power grid, with capital, rather than electricity, flowing through it. But just as a power grid can be strained beyond its capacity, so too can a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfinancial gridÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ collapse if its functions are distorted, as happened with Wall Street as it became increasingly self-serving and motivated solely by short-term profits. Through probing analysis, meticulous research, and dozens of interviews with the bankers, traders, research analysts, and investment managers who have been on the front lines of financial booms and busts, McGee provides a practical understanding of our financial ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œutility,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and how it touches everyone directly as an investor and indirectly through the powerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½capitalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that makes the economy work.\n\nWall Street is as important to the economy and the overall functioning of our society as our electric and water utilities. But it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t act that way. The financial system has been saved from destruction but as long as the mind-set of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œchasing Goldman SachsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ lingers, it will not have been reformed. As banking undergoes its biggest transformation since the 1929 crash and the Great Depression, McGee shows where it stands today and points to where it needs to go next, examining the future of those financial institutions supposedly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtoo big to fail.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Goldman-Sachs-Universe-Down/dp/0307888312/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324579840&amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Goldman-Sachs-Universe-Down/dp/0307888312/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324579840&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba5244c1c4b26429a4f60e1a7a9b4694f10f9e26","amp;dn":"Chasing+Goldman+Sachs%3A+How+the+Masters+of+the+Universe+Melted+Wa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba5244c1c4b26429a4f60e1a7a9b4694f10f9e26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,82,68,193,196,178,100,41,164,246,14,26,122,155,70,148,241,15,158,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
