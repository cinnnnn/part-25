It was a major hit, spending seven weeks at number one on the Billboard R&amp;B singles chart, reaching number five on Billboard's pop singles chart in the fall of 1980 and peaking at number two on the UK Singles chart. The song, built on a heavy reggae feel, is an ode to reggae legend Bob Marley; Wonder had been performing with Marley a few times in concerts (and actually billed him as an opening act) on his US tour in the fall of that year. Lyrics mention Marley, joining as &quot;children of Jah&quot;, and the end of the civil war in Zimbabwe.\n     &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; is a 1981 single written, produced, and performed by Stevie Wonder for the Motown label. Wonder, a social activist, was one of the main figures in the campaign to have the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. become a national holiday, and created this single to make the cause known. Besides being released as a single, the song also appears on Wonder's album &quot;Hotter Than July&quot;. Although the single failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100, it charted on the R&amp;B chart, and it became one of Wonder's biggest hits in the UK, reaching No.2 in the charts in August 1981\n     &quot;Part-Time Lover&quot; is a 1985 single by Stevie Wonder, from his album &quot;In Square Circle&quot;. The song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, R&amp;B, dance and adult contemporary charts. The song's simultaneous chart success made him the first artist to score a number-one hit on four different Billboard charts. The song also reached number three on the UK singles chart. The song also featured R&amp;B crooner Luther Vandross humming at the end of Stevie's verses and on backing vocals. Stevie Wonder earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance in 1986, for the song.\n     &quot;So What the Fuss&quot; is a song from Stevie Wonder's 2005 album A Time to Love. The single, which features Prince and the original four members of En Vogue, became a minor hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and went top 40 on Billboard's R&amp;B chart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:693ea5618136a49e5191cf826d288aa7cd778a13","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+506","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"693ea5618136a49e5191cf826d288aa7cd778a13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,62,165,97,129,54,164,158,81,145,207,130,109,40,138,167,205,119,138,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
