Far from gorging on sumptuous food and wine, lying on ravishing beaches and enjoying breathtaking architecture, Paul will be exploring some of the lesser-known areas of the continent. &quot;Prepare to see Europe like you've never seen it before,&quot; he promises.\n\nPart6:\nIn the final episode, Paul travels to Spain, where he encounters a former monk who has spent the last half-century building a gigantic church  single-handedly. At a bullfight, he witness a spectacular display of acrobatics that leaves the animal in one piece. Elsewhere, Paul takes part in a gigantic human tower, learns about the legacy of the Civil War and tries his hand at flamenco. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.five.tv/programmes/documentaries/paul-merton-in-europe/61927&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.five.tv/programmes/documentaries/paul-merton-in-europe/61927&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Specs for Std Def\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1600Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.800\nFrames per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 160Kbps 48KHz\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 45mins\nPart Size: 568MB\nNumber of Parts: 6\nSubtitles: Not Available\nripped by: JungleBoy\nSource: DVB-T\n\nforums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec8370b9f9dbdf9d0576eb67b5b6aaea668afaed","amp;dn":"Paul+Merton+in+Europe+6of6+PDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec8370b9f9dbdf9d0576eb67b5b6aaea668afaed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,131,112,185,249,219,223,157,5,118,235,103,181,182,170,234,102,138,250,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
