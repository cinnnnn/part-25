Like so many others, I didn't think it was fair, so this is for those people who were never fortunate enough to buy it before it was removed.\n\nMade from the real thing as BIN files so as not to break up the tracks, thereby keeping the continuity and the disk in the original form. You will need to burn each disk to a CD, from there you can make whatever file format you chose.\n\nI do not leave my computer on when I am not using it so please be patient and seed when you have it.\nI have included reworked scans of the back and front, also scans of the leaflet but not the disks.\nThe leaflet is old so the scans are not brilliant.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b97f2bbfb3ef19cc7870dc9834b82cbcc66e242e","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+The+Best+Band+You+Never+Heard+%28original+with+Boler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b97f2bbfb3ef19cc7870dc9834b82cbcc66e242e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,127,43,191,179,239,25,204,120,112,220,152,52,184,44,188,198,110,36,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
