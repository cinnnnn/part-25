As well, the album's two title tracks are direct attacks on the Catholic Church, which are unique for an otherwise apolitical band. The opening track, &quot;Everything Flows&quot;, is a mellow powerpop-influenced song (unlike the rest of the album) that provides a sort of blueprint for their later work.[3]\n&quot;Everything Flows&quot; was later included in the compilation albums Deep Fried Fanclub and Four Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-Six Seconds Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A Short Cut to Teenage Fanclub. Those were released in 1995 and 2003, respectively.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f1e6f634703fc8e51ce407a9b7343b8346e4c99","amp;dn":"Teenage+Fanclub+-+A+Catholic+Education+%281990%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f1e6f634703fc8e51ce407a9b7343b8346e4c99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,30,111,99,71,3,252,142,81,206,64,122,155,115,67,184,52,110,76,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
