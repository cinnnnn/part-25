He appeared on big band projects led by Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Kenton and Randy Weston, but made his name adding his buoyant Afro-Cuban rhythms to small groups led by Kenny Burrell, Bennie Green, Gene Ammons, Sonny Rollins, Wynton Kelly and others. He also worked with Latin greats like Tito Puente and Machito and was in demand in New Yorkâ€™s studio session circles.\r\nAlthough he had led groups for specific gigs and record dates, the band heard on this recording was a permanent working group for a couple of years. \r\nTheir first album Thousand Finger Man was issued on the Solid State label, which was soon to be folded into the Blue Note label operation. In fact, that album's single (covers of Rufus Thomas's â€œJump Backâ€ and Booker T. and the MGs' â€œSoul Limboâ€) was issued on Blue Note.\r\nThis band fuses the traditions of Afro-Cuban jazz bands with the tight execution of Latin bands and the funk grooves of R&amp;B. Like the first album, this one contains contemporary covers of popular funk tunes of the day, but what gives this album lasting interest and values are â€œSerenade To A Savageâ€ and the two-part â€œGhana Spice.â€ â€œSerenadeâ€ is the unlikely revival of a 1939 Artie Shaw hit that has been transformed into a groove tune that showcases Candidoâ€™s amazing finger work backed just by the rhythm section. \r\nThe infectious, haunting â€œGhana Spiceâ€ is decidedly African in its melody and rhythm. Candido's congas, Herb Lovelle's drums and Richard Davis's bass line drive the rhythm over which Joe Grimm's flute states the melody. These tracks have become club and sampling favorites for their great beats and grooves.\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/FVmnaKR.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01. I'm On My Way    [3:11]\r\n02.
