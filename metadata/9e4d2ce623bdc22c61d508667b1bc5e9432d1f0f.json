In an effort to keep torrent sizes reasonable, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve decided to split 1993 into two volumes. This volume includes everything Dave Matthews Band related from the beginning of 1993 through the 6/15/93 Trax show. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also included some updates to the previous volume located in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“CorrectionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ folder. You can replace those shows from the original volume with this update. Please help us seed as much as you can.\n\nCountless hours of research has been put into this project, ensuring the most accurate archive possible. The highest quality sources available were always used. Every file is a 320 kbps MP3, with 600x600 pixel cover art in the style of the original DMBLive cover art for non-official releases. Everything has been carefully tagged so all ID3 tags are consistent, and most importantly, correct. \n\nComing soon... Volume 3: 1993 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Part 2.
