The quality is quite alright tough.\n\nProvided here since it should be available to everybody around the world and not just the United Kingdom.\n\n\nSource: http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/4od#3651833\nResolution: 852x480\nEncoding: H.264 - MPEG-4 AVC\nFPS: 30 (only 25 from source)\nRip method: Screencapture\n\nAudio: Stereo\nEncoding: MPEG AAC (mp4a)\nLanguage: English / Russian in Interviews\n\nSubtitles: The russian text is translated in english. Sadly it's rendered into the video though. English subtitles provided on request.\n\n\nThis 480p release is probbably not much worse to look at than the 720p version, considering the source might have been only 480p itself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10f89b766d155ee1952fa42a0d3376f30926ba94","amp;dn":"Hunted+Channel+4+Dispatches+Documentary+480p+30fps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10f89b766d155ee1952fa42a0d3376f30926ba94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,248,155,118,109,21,94,225,149,47,164,42,13,51,118,243,9,38,186,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
