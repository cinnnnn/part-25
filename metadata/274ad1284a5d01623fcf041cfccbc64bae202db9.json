Crime writer John Harvey travels to Sweden to find out, talking to people on the (beautifully clean) streets, shadowing a cop and tracking down Wallander's reclusive but lucid creator, Henning Mankell. BBC4 screens Swedish Wallander films tonight\n\nBy examining Mankells anti-hero Wallander, it reveals the hidden angst affecting present-day Sweden, a country with an excellent welfare system yet one which has suffered two shocking recent political assassinations. The film tries to grasp what Mankells characters say about Sweden and how his books inform the rest of the world about Scandinavias largest country.\n\n\nThis program was originally uploaded by &quot;geclipse&quot; at thebox.bz \n- theboz.bz is a private torrent tracker.
