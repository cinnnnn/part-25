One such woman was Sabina Spielrein. Unlike the rest, she didn't vanish forever from history. Elisabeth MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rton's film relates, restages and remembers the tragic story of Spielrein's life as gleaned from a box of her papers discovered in 1977 in the cellar of Geneva's former Institute of Psychology. Spielrein was a young Russian-Jewish woman of 18 when she arrived in August 1904 at the BurghÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶lzli clinic in Zurich where Carl Gustav Jung had set up shop. She was his first patient. He was 29 and married. Her cathexis was rapid and she formed an intense attachment to her young doctor, who seems to have reciprocated. But after Sigmund Freud's note (above) on the nefarious nature of females, the doctors hatched the theory of counter-transference to explain their feelings.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b68867bf0d2fc60c0ecbdcf286ffd8712f163626","amp;dn":"My+Name+was+Sabina+Spielrein+%28+basis+for+but+NOT+%5C%27A+DANGEROUS+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b68867bf0d2fc60c0ecbdcf286ffd8712f163626","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,136,103,191,13,47,198,12,14,203,220,242,134,255,216,113,47,22,54,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
