What if everything you knew about disaster survival came from old B-movies? What would you do if society as you know it suddenly became The Oblivion Society?\n\nAfter an accidental nuclear war reduces civilization to a smoldering ruin, grocery clerk Vivian Gray joins a comically inept bunch of twentysomething survivors, and together they try to ride out Armageddon on little more than scavenged junk food and half-remembered pop culture. When the contaminated atmosphere unleashes a menagerie of deadly atomic mutants, Vivian and her friends take to the interstate for a madcap cross-country road trip toward a distant sanctuary that may not, in the strictest sense of the word, exist.\n\nBut can they get to safety before the toxins get to them?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5a0cb1cc8fa69e78bf11b50c7e2adba3615e155","amp;dn":"The+Oblivion+Society+-+Marcus+A+Hart.-+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5a0cb1cc8fa69e78bf11b50c7e2adba3615e155","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,160,203,28,200,250,105,231,139,241,27,80,199,226,173,186,54,21,225,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
