Wale) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ iTunes Plus M4A Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2014\n\nGenres: Rock, Music\nReleased: 21 March 2014\nÃ¢â€žâ€” 2014 Mercury Records Limited\n\nAs part of a grand 40th-anniversary reissue of Elton JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s landmark album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, a mob of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musicians are going to cover every single song on the original album. And the most puzzling of those artists is the pairing of Miguel and Wale, who team up to cover Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bennie And The Jets,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ maybe the most personality-soaked and impossible-to-cover songs in Elton JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oeuvre. (Amazingly, though, Wale is not the first rapper to be involved in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bennie And the JetsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ cover.) The Miguel version is a weird experiment in combining old-school songcraft with new-school production techniques, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a pretty confusing mess even before Wale shows up. Listen to it below.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f11e3bf0bcab25dea89c30f187ff5a5654854f2f","amp;dn":"Miguel+-+Bennie+and+the+Jets+%28feat.+Wale%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f11e3bf0bcab25dea89c30f187ff5a5654854f2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,30,59,240,188,171,37,222,168,156,48,241,135,255,90,86,84,133,79,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
