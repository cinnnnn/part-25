In the lecture videos, Professor Jonathan Gruber covers the principles of microeconomics conceptually, mathematically, and graphically, giving students a holistic understanding of the subject matter. He then moves on to more advanced topics in microeconomics to provide further insight into its many different applications.\n\nIn the problem solving videos, a teaching assistant demonstrates their approach to questions from the problem set. The problems selected by the TA cover a range of microeconomics topics and problem solving techniques that students need to master to successfully complete this course.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07710c091ce5feed3518ee6361e70cf96685fedd","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Microeconomics+MIT+14.01SC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07710c091ce5feed3518ee6361e70cf96685fedd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,113,12,9,28,229,254,237,53,24,238,99,97,231,12,249,102,133,254,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
