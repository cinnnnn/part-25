Sutton - The Best Enemy Money Can Buy (1986)\n\nThe business of lending blood money is one of the most thoroughly sordid, cold blooded, and criminal acts that were ever carried on, to any considerable extent, amongst human beings. It is like lending money to slave traders, or to common robbers and pirates, to be repaid out of their plunder. And the man who loans money to governments, so called, for the purpose of enabling the latter to rob, enslave and murder their own people, are among the greatest villains that the world has ever seen.\n\nWith mountains of documentation, mostly from government and corporate sources, Sutton shows that Soviet military technology is heavily dependent on U.S. and allied gifts, &quot;peaceful trade&quot; and exchange programs. We've built for, sold, traded, or given outright to the Communists everything from copper wiring and military trucks to tank technology, missile guidance technology, and computers - even the Space Shuttle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52e780796210ce92f011b20e1cb5cc681aace002","amp;dn":"Antony+C.+Sutton+-+The+Best+Enemy+Money+Can+Buy+%281986%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52e780796210ce92f011b20e1cb5cc681aace002","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,231,128,121,98,16,206,146,240,17,178,14,28,181,204,104,26,172,224,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
