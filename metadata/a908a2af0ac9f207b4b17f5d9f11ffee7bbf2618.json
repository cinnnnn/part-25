His home is Castle Frankenburg, dating from 1878, a wooden fairytale mansion which also houses his famous picture and electronic music studio Andromeda.\nSince 1959 he has lived an independent life, creating his own personal musical language, and preparing original films and exhibitions. His song Out in the Wide World serves as the signature tune for Radio Sweden International broadcasts.\nDuring the 1950's Ralph Lundsten built his own electronic musical instruments and was one of the first pioneers in this field.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a908a2af0ac9f207b4b17f5d9f11ffee7bbf2618","amp;dn":"Ralph+Lundsten+-+En+Midvinter+Saga+-+Vinylrip+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a908a2af0ac9f207b4b17f5d9f11ffee7bbf2618","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,8,162,175,10,201,242,7,180,177,127,93,159,17,255,238,123,191,38,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
