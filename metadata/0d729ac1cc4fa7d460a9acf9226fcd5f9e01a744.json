This\nrelease is iNTERNAL because of the fact I've messed around with this a lot and\nit's re-encoded from an AVI already available on the internet. Also the audio\nis only mono (both sources were) and it's also only 44,100Hz, when it would\nusually be in stereo 48,000Hz. The recordings are from Cartoon Network\nAustralia and Cartoon Network Nordic. Also, I kept the movie letterboxed and\ndidn't crop it to 16:9 because the first two shots are in 4:3; I'm not sure if\nthey're meant to be like this but this is how they were in the source. No\nsource in the release name because there are multiple sources. Read below for\ndetails on what I did.\n\nSources:\n1st: &quot;Ed Edd and Eddy's Big Picture Show (divx).avi&quot;, 'shadowcanti' YT(?).\n2nd: &quot;Ed Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show - SPOILER - clip of the end&quot;, YT\n     video by 'spretten', recorded with camera.\n\nWork Done:\n1: Took 1st source, fixed sync and cut off credits. Removed CN bumper &quot;blips&quot;.\n   Cropped unneeded black borders and encoded.\n2: Took credits and cropped so it was only them appearing on screen, as source\n   had them squashed with no audio. Added audio from 2nd source and encoded.\n3: Took AKA Cartoon/Cartoon Network logo at the end, cropped like stage 1 and\n   encoded.\n4: Put all parts together and encoded like a normal release.\n\nThat's about it really! By the way, when this airs in the UK I will have a\nbetter source and I'll release it again, probably then deleting this release.\nAlso, if you want to read the credits properly, go find the 2nd source.\nShouldn't be hard to find as it IS on;) Enjoy! =D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d729ac1cc4fa7d460a9acf9226fcd5f9e01a744","amp;dn":"Ed.Edd.n.Eddys.Big.Picture.Show.2009.TV.iNTERNAL.XviD-ZOTON2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d729ac1cc4fa7d460a9acf9226fcd5f9e01a744","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,114,154,193,204,79,167,212,96,169,172,249,34,111,205,95,158,1,167,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
