Now one of the volumes, The Book of Spies, has surfaced, as have its clandestine ownersÃ¢â‚¬â€a cabal of the globeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful, dangerous men.\n\nWhen the CIA discovers a connection between the legendary library and a bank account linked to terrorists, they bring in rare-books curator Eva Blake. Soon an attempt is made on EvaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€and she is on the run. Determined not only to survive but to uncover the truth, Eva turns to the only person she can trust: Judd Ryder, a former intelligence officer with a troubled past and an agenda of his own.\n\nRacing from London to Rome, Istanbul to Athens, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Judd and Eva to track down the gold-covered, bejeweled books in the fabulous libraryÃ¢â‚¬â€and find a way to stay ahead of the men who will stop at nothing to protect their interestsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and are dead-set on keeping their secrets hidden.\n\n\nMP3 CD\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc.; Unabridged MP3CD edition (March 30, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1441726926\nISBN-13: 978-1441726926\n\nGayle Lynds  (Author) , Kate Reading (Reader)\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
