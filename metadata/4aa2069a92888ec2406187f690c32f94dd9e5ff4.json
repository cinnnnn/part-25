While Astral Weeks and Moondance contemplate the cosmos and love's rich conundrums, Street Choir resonates with a purposefully loose ebullience on songs like the Top Ten hit &quot;Domino,&quot; &quot;Blue Money,&quot; and &quot;Call Me Up In Dreamland.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis remastered version of the album is expanded with five unreleased bonus tracks, including an early, raw take of &quot;Give Me Kiss&quot; without piano, horns or backing vocals. Morrison's impressive falsetto gets a workout on Take 3 of &quot;Gypsy Queen,&quot; while the band turns up the funk on the greasy alternate version of &quot;I've Been Working&quot; that's featured here.\r\n\r\nTRACKLIST:\r\n\r\n1.
