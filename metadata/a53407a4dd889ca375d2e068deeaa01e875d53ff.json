The band is composed of four animated band members: 2D (lead vocals, keyboard), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (lead guitar and occasional vocals) and Russel (drums and percussion). The band's music is a collaboration between various musicians, Albarn being the only permanent musical contributor. Their style is a composition of multiple musical genres, with a large number of their influences including: dub, hip hop, alternative rock, electronic and pop music.\n\nThe band's eponymous debut album, released in 2001, sold over seven million copies and earned them an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records as the Most Successful Virtual Band. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize 2001, but the nomination was later withdrawn at the band's request. Their second studio album, Demon Days, was released in 2005 and included the singles &quot;Feel Good Inc.&quot;, &quot;Dare&quot;, &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and &quot;Kids with Guns&quot;/&quot;El MaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ana&quot;. Demon Days went five times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the United States and earned five Grammy Award nominations for 2006 and won one of them in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals category. Gorillaz have also released two B-sides compilations and a remix album. The combined sales of Gorillaz and Demon Days had, by 2007, exceeded 15 million albums. The band's third studio album, titled Plastic Beach, will be released on 3 March 2010 in Japan, 8 March 2010 in the United Kingdom and 9 March 2010 in the United States.\n\nPlastic Beach Track List:\n\n01 Orchestral Intro (ft.
