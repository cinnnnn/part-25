How Is This Possible? Aaron Klein, Breitbart Jerusalem.\r\n\r\napril 6,2016 John Batchelor mp3\r\n\r\nâ€¦Al-Qaeda-affiliated rebels from the Al-Nusra Front reportedly captured the pilot alive and brought him to their headquarters. He has since been identified as Col. Khaled Saeed, and he appeared in an Al-Nusra propaganda video confirming his capture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe event marks the second time the Syrian government says it was attacked in recent weeks by rebels deploying antiaircraft missiles. The Syrian military last month said one of its warplanes was shot down in western Syria in March.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe L.A. Times provided some background on the rebelsâ€™ attempts to obtain anti-aircraft weapons:\r\n\r\nâ€œEarlier in the war, rebel groups managed to obtain some shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles from Syrian Army depots and from the government of Qatar. They have long argued that they need a reliable supply of the missiles, known as man-portable air-defense systems.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe United States, Saudi Arabia, and other backers have rejected their pleas amid concern that the missiles could fall into the hands of Islamist militants and be used against Western targets.\r\n\r\nâ€œSo just how did the rebels suddenly obtain the missiles? Were they transferred by an Arab government that opposes the Assad regime or Syriaâ€™s Russian backers?...â€\r\n \nhttp://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2016/04/06/analysis-use-antiaircraft-missiles-syria-marks-major-escalation-poses-international-threat/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bae1e0ea3aaf9625d77e3190ec2c3b0ddd9da24","amp;dn":"JohnBatchelor-syria-rebels--US-stinger-missiles-breitbart.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bae1e0ea3aaf9625d77e3190ec2c3b0ddd9da24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,174,30,14,163,170,249,98,93,119,227,25,14,194,195,176,221,217,218,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
