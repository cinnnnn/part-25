The band is still too\nself-indulgent for its own good at times, but it&amp;#039;s less of a problem than\nbefore. Though nothing on this CD is in a class with &quot;Three Little Pigs,&quot; tracks\nlike &quot;The Bear Song&quot; (which almost sounds like a sequel to &quot;Pigs&quot;), &quot;Jerk,&quot;\n&quot;Carnage Rules&quot; and &quot;Pinata Hed&quot; showed that the rockers still weren&amp;#039;t afraid to\nhave a great deal of fun. Consistently irreverent, Jelly doesn&amp;#039;t hesitate to\nparody everyone from Ministry to Guns N&amp;#039; Roses to the Beastie Boys.\n\nPointless Technical Details:\nRipped on Linux with cdparanoia III 9.8, encoded with standard FLAC 1.1.2 at\nfull compression.\n\nTrack Listing:\n 1. Carnage Rules\n 2. Orange Krunch\n 3. Pinata Hed\n 4. Fixation\n 5. The Bear Song\n 6. Fight\n 7. Super Elastic\n 8. Jump\n 9. Jerk\n10. Anthem\n11. Slave Boy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c3737526d3a355c090b3f73851b59f3bbb7bc50","amp;dn":"Green+Jelly+-+333+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c3737526d3a355c090b3f73851b59f3bbb7bc50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,55,55,82,109,58,53,92,9,11,63,115,133,27,89,243,187,183,188,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
