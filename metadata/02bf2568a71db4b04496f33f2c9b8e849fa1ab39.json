In Perfect Murder, Perfect Town, bestselling author Lawrence Schiller explores both the child's mysterious death and the exhaustive, yet often mishandled, investigation that has, in the two years since the crime, failed to produce either a plausible scenario or a killer. The more that was discovered about the crime, the less likelihood there seemed of tying all the evidence into a single theory that fit the murder scene. Meanwhile, conflicting agendas and personalities within the Boulder police department, the district attorney's office, and the sheriff's office escalated a war that has all but eroded the picture-postcard image of liberal, laid-back Boulder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02bf2568a71db4b04496f33f2c9b8e849fa1ab39","amp;dn":"Perfect+Murder%2C+Perfect+Town+-+Lawrence+Schiller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02bf2568a71db4b04496f33f2c9b8e849fa1ab39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,191,37,104,167,29,180,176,68,150,243,63,44,155,142,132,159,161,171,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
