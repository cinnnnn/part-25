While there are no easy answers, Alex Yermolinsky is better qualified than most to offer advice. Having found the famed &quot;Soviet School of Chess&quot; wanting, he trained himself, slowly but surely raising his game to top-class grandmaster standard.\n\nIn this book, he passes on many of the insights he has gained over the years. He steers the reader away from &quot;quick fix&quot; approaches, and focuses on the critical areas of chess understanding and over-the-board decision-making. This entertainingly written book breaks new ground in many areas of chess understanding.\n\nTopics covered include: Trend-Breaking Tools; The Burden of Small Advantages; What Exchanges Are For; Classics Revisited; and Computer Chess. A large part of the book discusses a variety of important opening set-ups, including methods for opposing offbeat but dangerous lines, such as the Grand Prix Attack.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6248f21b92db77a9e1dcf96b1a2210c2089b645b","amp;dn":"+The+Road+to+Chess+Improvement+%28Alex+Yermolinsky%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6248f21b92db77a9e1dcf96b1a2210c2089b645b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,72,242,27,146,219,119,169,225,220,249,107,26,34,16,194,8,155,100,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
