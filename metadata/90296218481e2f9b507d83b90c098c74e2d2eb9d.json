This edition sees 40 Glocc before he was a joke (fight and subsequent lawsuit vs. The Game), Murs right after he cut his dreads off, Mac Miller on his mixtape grind right before he really blew up (as well as home video footage of him rapping to Rapper's Delight when he was like 5), Slim Dunkin before his physical body was murdered, an early breakout hit for Problem ft. Ty$ (now known as Ty DollaSign, Mayer Hawthorne's awesome song and video which features old footage of a Detroit dance TV show, Jaleel White (Urkel) as Cee-Lo Green, a Rockie Fresh and Casey Veggies collabo before they both blew up, the unlikely collab of Pusha-T and Tyler the Creator, and Prince Ea spits his verse forward AND backward! Megabone closes out the show with the dope &quot;Pilldren&quot;.\n\n&quot;The war on drugs is a war on us. \nThey bring it on the plane and they put us on a bus. \nThey give it to the kids and they want to lock us up. \nIt's mass pollution, we the pilldren.&quot;\n\nBlazin' Hot Hip-Hop drops next week if all goes well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90296218481e2f9b507d83b90c098c74e2d2eb9d","amp;dn":"Blazin%27+Music+Videos+%28Rap%2C+RnB%2C+Pop%29+August+2011+NTSC+DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90296218481e2f9b507d83b90c098c74e2d2eb9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,41,98,24,72,30,47,155,80,125,131,185,12,9,140,116,226,210,235,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
