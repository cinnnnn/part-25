But in 1940 Great Britainâ€™s defeat loomed perilously close, and no other nation stepped up to confront the Nazi threat. In this cogently argued book, Robin Prior delves into the documents of the timeâ€”war diaries, combat reports, Home Securityâ€™s daily files, and much moreâ€”to uncover how Britain endured a year of menacing crises.\r\n \r\nThe book reassesses key events of 1940â€”crises that were recognized as such at the time and others not fully appreciated. Prior examines Neville Chamberlainâ€™s government, Churchillâ€™s opponents, the collapse of France, the Battle of Britain, and the Blitz. He looks critically at the position of the United States before Pearl Harbor, and at Rooseveltâ€™s response to the crisis. Prior concludes that the nation was saved through a combination of political leadership, British Expeditionary Force determination and skill, Royal Air Force and Navy efforts to return soldiers to the homeland, and the determination of the people to fight on â€œin spite of all terror.â€ As eloquent as it is controversial, this book exposes the full import of events in 1940, when Britain fought alone and Western civilization hung in the balance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:529938de21142156f38dee4c5016b1385a46dcb5","amp;dn":"When+Britain+Saved+the+West+-+The+Story+of+1940+%282015%29pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"529938de21142156f38dee4c5016b1385a46dcb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,153,56,222,33,20,33,86,243,141,238,76,80,22,177,56,90,70,220,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
