It includes detailed explanations of the key theory underlying biomechanics testing, along with advice concerning choice of equipment and how to use your laboratory equipment most effectively. The book covers the following important topics in detail:\n\nmotion analysis using video and on-line systems\nmeasurement of force and pressure in the laboratory and field\nmeasurement of power using isokinetic dynamometry\nelectromyography\ncomputational simulation and modelling of human movement\nresearch methodologies, data processing and data smoothing.\nContributors include world leading researchers and pioneers such as Roger Bartlett, Carl Payton, Vasilios (Bill) Baltzopoulos, Adrian Burden, John H. Challis, and computer modelling maestro Fred Yeadon.  Biomechanical Evaluation of Movement in Sport and Exercise is a must-have text for all biomechanics laboratories and students undertaking research.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8eba35f6d6f6b9d485d4dc8a1bb411f0e6adecb","amp;dn":"Biomechanical+Evaluation+of+Movement+in+Sport+%26amp%3B+Exercise+-+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8eba35f6d6f6b9d485d4dc8a1bb411f0e6adecb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,235,163,95,109,111,107,157,72,93,77,200,161,187,65,31,14,106,222,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
