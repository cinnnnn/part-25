Similar in their emotional urgency to her more recent work but delightfully less polished, these folk-rock songs are surprising gems. If not for McLachlan&amp;#039;s poignant vocals, lyrics like &quot;Your love is better than ice cream&quot; (on &quot;Ice Cream&quot;) would sound childishly absurd (especially alongside deeper material like &quot;Hold On&quot;), but here they&amp;#039;re given just as much respect as the weightier issues she explores. A great album to accompany your moments of introspection. --Rebecca Wallwork ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2236a922642633ee383ff14c4b4086b786dee47a","amp;dn":"Sarah+McLachlan+-+Fumbling+Towards+Ecstasy+%5B1993%5D+MP3+vbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2236a922642633ee383ff14c4b4086b786dee47a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,54,169,34,100,38,51,238,56,63,241,76,75,64,134,183,134,222,228,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
