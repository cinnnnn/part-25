Henri Ducharmes and his two children are on their way from New Orleans to the Californian Eldorado when they're attacked by a small group of renegades. Ed Fisher, an old and ornery cowpoke, intervenes to save young Mary from the massacre. They hold-up in a broken down hacienda to await the dawn, when the rest of the Indian band are expected to attack.\r\n\r\nDuring a long and sleepless night, Ed relates his adventurous and cursed life, and the tragedies that hound him. One major theme -- slaughter of the buffalo -- was central to the conquest of the West, since it weakened the Indians and allowed the development of ranches and rail lines, and the parceling of the plains.\r\n\r\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13e5dcc59424bec913732d6b644a04aec70a698a","amp;dn":"Buffalo+Runner+-+One+Shot+-+%282015%29+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13e5dcc59424bec913732d6b644a04aec70a698a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,229,220,197,148,36,190,201,19,115,45,107,100,74,4,174,199,10,105,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
