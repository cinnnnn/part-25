Accompanied by Ramesh Misra on a sarangi -- a bowed lute that has both melodic and sympathetic strings -- this eminent duo develops innumerable variations within tintal, a 16-beat rhythmic cycle. For over an hour the pair establish themes, improvise upon them, and confidently venture out way beyond the usual limits of temporal terra firma. Ustad Alla Rakha begins the performance with the weaving of a peshkar, a kind of rhythmic improvisation that opens traditional tabla solos. Ustad Alla Rakha combines kaidas (improvisations on a fixed theme) with relas (faster improvisations) in the development of his peshkar. At this point Ustad Zakir Hussain takes the tabla baton and runs with it, adding variations of timbre and form to his father's manifestations. From there the father and son exchange improvisations, swell into perfectly coordinated cadences, and manifest a number of traditional classical compositions. Tabla Duet is not a CD for the regressive listener. Those who would rather passively absorb the banal beats of a typical pop band than actively listen to the development of sophisticated rhythmic dialogues should avoid this CD. This is not to say that Tabla Duet is only suitable for rhythm junkies and drum circle fanatics. In actuality, Tabla Duet is a CD for anyone who seeks out musics that reflect collaborations of the highest caliber.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nTRACKLIST\n01.
