He achieved some success by having two hits in the 1980s.\n\n&quot;Naughty Naughty&quot; was Parr's first U.S. top 40 hit record. The song built his career very quickly by achieving the number 1 position on every rock radio station in America for up to 12 weeks. 1985 saw Parr on the road with his band &quot;The Business&quot; supporting Toto, and playing 10,000-seater venues across America. By the end of the tour, John had a call from one of the world's most successful record producers, David Foster. He requested Parr to record a song for the film &quot;St Elmo's Fire&quot;. Parr and Foster wrote a song in honor of wheelchair athlete and activist Rick Hansen, the song was called &quot;St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)&quot; which also became the theme for the movie St. Elmo's Fire (a &quot;Brat Pack&quot; film unrelated to Hansen's life and achievements). The song became a Number one hit for Parr around the world and garnered many awards, including a Grammy nomination.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dbb86d28c45a54d5176d44271a7b8ef2a03ad3a","amp;dn":"John+Parr+-+Naughty+Naughty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dbb86d28c45a54d5176d44271a7b8ef2a03ad3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,187,134,210,140,69,165,77,81,118,212,66,113,167,184,239,42,3,173,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
