Kissing Air (7:04)\n\n\nPretty decent one-off CD from when the main guy behind FFS decided to do a band album, interesting sounds throughout and definitely worth a download.\n\nFrom Last.fm:\nFUTURE FUNK SQUAD is actually just one person, ÃƒÂ¼ber-producer Glen Nicholls. One of the most respected figures in the international breakbeat scene, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remixed more name artists than you can shake a funky stick at and DJÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d all over the world.\nThe Prodigy (twice), UNKLE, White Lies, Hybrid, Muse, Mylo, Stanton Warriors and Bomb The Bass are just a few of the acts whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve benefited from a FFS respray, not to mention some of his childhood heroes such as Yazoo.\nFuture Funk Squad did become a band in the mid-noughties, producing the acclaimed Ã¢â‚¬ËœAudio DamageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ album and touring with a full six-piece live set-up. But lately Glen has taken the FFS sound back to its DJ/producer roots, releasing the Ã¢â‚¬ËœDisorders Of SkillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ album and leaving behind the record label that tried to make him go too commercial.
