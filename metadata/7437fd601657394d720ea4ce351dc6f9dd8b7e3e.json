Was it my imagination gone wild? No. After all those years of teaching elementary school, I knew this child was afraid.&quot;\nAfter a chance encounter on the subway, Miss Augusta Weidenmaier, a retired schoolteacher living in New York's Greenwich Village, is determined to help the police in the search for missing nine-year-old child actor Kevin Corcoran. Never mind that she has no training in law enforcement-she spent decades teaching. She knows when someone is lying.\nOnce set upon a course of action, the indomitable Miss Weidenmaier cannot be swayed-or intimidated. Facing down megalomaniacal business executives, stuck-up celebrities, pushy stage mothers and a rabble-rousing talk show host, Miss Weidenmaier will stop at nothing-not even the disapproval of one Lieutenant Brown of the NYPD, who does not take kindly to amateur sleuthing-to bring young Kevin home.\nGenre: Fiction, Mystery/Thriller\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7437fd601657394d720ea4ce351dc6f9dd8b7e3e","amp;dn":"Scene+Stealer+-+Elise+Warner.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7437fd601657394d720ea4ce351dc6f9dd8b7e3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,55,253,96,22,87,57,77,114,14,164,206,53,29,198,249,221,139,126,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
