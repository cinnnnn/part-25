With plans to build a railroad through both families' land and mine coal deposits beneath it, enterprising outsider Jack Hale (Fred MacMurray) inadvertently becomes entangled in the region's politics. He soon captures the attention of the beautiful June Tolliver (Sylvia Sidney) and quickly becomes involved in a love triangle with her and her cousin Dave (Henry Fonda) \n\n\nWritten by tonyman \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028401&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028401&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8b61427da92448ac42002522c592c3303f79fca","amp;dn":"The+Trail+of+the+Lonesome+Pine.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8b61427da92448ac42002522c592c3303f79fca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,182,20,39,218,146,68,138,196,32,2,82,44,89,44,51,3,247,159,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
