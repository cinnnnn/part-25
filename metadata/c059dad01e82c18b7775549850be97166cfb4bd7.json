Released in 2004, almost three years after the band separated in December 2001, it contains an unusual mix of hit singles, key album tracks, B-sides and some rarer tracks, making the release useful for collectors. &quot;So Long Marianne&quot; (a cover of the Leonard Cohen song originally recorded for the 1991 tribute album I'm Your Fan) and &quot;Confusion&quot; (from the Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased) soundtrack) appear here for the first time on any James release, &quot;Once a Friend&quot; for the first time on CD, &quot;Lazy&quot; for the first time on a UK release and &quot;Coffee and Toast&quot; for the first time as anything other than a download. The album was produced to provide a retrospective look at James' career; however, it was released with no marketing campaign and without any input from band members, generating little critical interest.
