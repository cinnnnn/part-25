The material is divided into five parts. The first part (Chapters 1-3) is mathematically oriented and deals with continuous-time (analog) signals. The second part (Chapters 4-5) is again mathematically based and deals with Fourier transforms, Hartley transforms, Laplace and Hilbert transforms. The third part (Chapters 6-7) presents basic system analysis, approximations, and analog filter circuits using op-amps. The fourth part (Chapters 8-9) deals with discrete signals, fast algorithms and digital filters. The fifth part deals with an introduction to analog communication systems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c2a53be8b5d35af34cbed4fab0cd732c8970c11","amp;dn":"Analog+and+Digital+Signals+and+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c2a53be8b5d35af34cbed4fab0cd732c8970c11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,42,83,190,139,93,53,175,52,203,237,79,171,12,215,50,200,151,12,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
