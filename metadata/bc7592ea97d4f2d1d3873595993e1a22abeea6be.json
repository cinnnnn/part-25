First, the guy comes during Jeopardy, so I didn't get to record today's new episode, second, they tell me I dont get HD with the boxes they are providing and that the HD ones are $10/mth more. Then I learn (and this is the deal breaker) that my tv-tuner card in my computer cant change the channels anymore. So I've been researching an IR Blaster solution, but cant seem to find a feasible solution. I'm going to talk with them tomorrow, but I think cable is just not going to work...F**K COMCAST!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc7592ea97d4f2d1d3873595993e1a22abeea6be","amp;dn":"Jeopardy%21.S2013E98.2013-05-16.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc7592ea97d4f2d1d3873595993e1a22abeea6be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,117,146,234,151,212,242,209,211,135,53,149,153,62,26,34,171,238,166,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
