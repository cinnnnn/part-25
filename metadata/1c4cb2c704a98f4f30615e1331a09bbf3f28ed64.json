Under the leadership of guitarist Gary Richrath, this album continued the musical direction set on 1971's R.E.O. Speedwagon with Richrath's own classic compositions carrying the record. R.E.O./T.W.O launched REO on its first national tour and presented a more polished production than the band's debut album.\n\nThe album introduced Kevin Cronin as vocalist and contributing song writer to the band, replacing Terry Luttrell. Highlights of the album include Richrath's &quot;Golden Country,&quot; a compelling political statement with possibly his finest guitar solo as well as &quot;Like You Do.&quot; Both songs, as well as Cronin's &quot;Music Man,&quot; have stood the test of time and are frequently part of the band's current set list.\n\nTrack listing [320k MP3]\n\n01 &quot;Let Me Ride&quot; (Cronin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:00 \n02 &quot;How the Story Goes&quot; (Richrath) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34 \n03 &quot;Little Queenie&quot; (Berry) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:39 \n04 &quot;Being Kind (Can Hurt Someone Sometimes)&quot; (Cronin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:02 \n05 &quot;Music Man&quot; (Cronin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38 \n06 &quot;Like You Do&quot; (Richrath) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:57 \n07 &quot;Flash Tan Queen&quot; (Richrath) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23 \n08 &quot;Golden Country&quot; (Richrath) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:33 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c4cb2c704a98f4f30615e1331a09bbf3f28ed64","amp;dn":"REO+Speedwagon+-+%5C%27R.E.O.%2FT.W.O.%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c4cb2c704a98f4f30615e1331a09bbf3f28ed64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,76,178,199,4,169,143,79,48,97,94,19,49,160,155,191,63,40,237,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
