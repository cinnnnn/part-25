He developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). He is best known in popular culture for his massÃ¢â‚¬â€œenergy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed &quot;the world's most famous equation&quot;). He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect&quot;. The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.\n\nEinstein published more than 300 scientific papers along with over 150 non-scientific works. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word &quot;Einstein&quot; synonymous with genius.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Essays in Humanism (Open Road, 2011)\n\nAn inspiring collection of the great thinkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s views on a rapidly changing world Nuclear proliferation, Zionism, and the global economy are just a few of the insightful and surprisingly prescient topics scientist Albert Einstein discusses in this volume of collected essays from between 1931 and 1950. Written with a clear voice and a thoughtful perspective on the effects of science, economics, and politics in daily life, EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writings provide an intriguing view inside the mind of a genius addressing the philosophical challenges presented during the turbulence of the Great Depression, the Second World War, and the dawn of the Cold War. This authorized Philosophical Library ebook features rare photos and never-before-seen documents from the Albert Einstein Archives at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\n* Essays In Science (Open Road, 2011)\n\nAn homage to the men and women of science, and an exposition of EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place in scientific history In this fascinating collection of articles and speeches, Albert Einstein reflects not only on the scientific method at work in his own theoretical discoveries, but eloquently expresses a great appreciation for his scientific contemporaries and forefathers, including Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell, Max Planck, and Niels Bohr. While Einstein is renowned as one of the foremost innovators of modern science, his discoveries uniquely his own, through his own words it becomes clear that Einstein viewed himself as only the most recent in a long line of scientists driven to create new ways of understanding the world and to prove their scientific theories. EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thoughtful examinations explain the Ã¢â‚¬Å“howÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of scientific innovations both in his own theoretical work and in the scientific method established by those who came before him. This authorized Philosophical Library ebook features a new introduction by Neil Berger, PhD, and an illustrated biography of Albert Einstein, which includes rare photos and never-before-seen documents from the Albert Einstein Archives at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\n* Letters On Wave Mechanics: Correspondence with H. A. Lorentz, Max Planck, and Erwin SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger (Open Road, 2011)\n\nA lively collection of EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s groundbreaking scientific correspondence on modern physics with SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger, Planck, and LorentzImagine getting four of the greatest minds of modern physics in a room together to explain and debate the theories and innovations of their day. This is the fascinating experience of reading Letters on Wave Mechanics, the correspondence between Erwin SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger and Max Planck, H.A. Lorentz, and Albert Einstein. These remarkable letters illuminate not only the basis of SchrÃƒÂ¶dingerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work in wave mechanics, but also how great scientific minds debated and challenged the ever-changing theories of the day and ultimately embraced an elegant solution to the riddles of quantum theory. Their collected correspondence offers insight into both the personalities and professional aspirations that played a part in this theoretical breakthrough.This authorized Philosophical Library ebook features rare photos and never-before-seen documents from the Albert Einstein Archives at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \n\n* Letters To Solovine: 1906-1955 (Open Road, 2011)\n\nA provocative collection of letters to his longtime friend and translator that spans EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career and reveals the inner thoughts and daily life of a transformative geniusFrom their early days as tutor and scholar, discussing philosophy over Spartan dinners, to their work together to publish EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s books in Europe, in Maurice Solovine Einstein found both an engaged mind and a loyal friend. While Einstein frequently shared his observations on science, politics, philosophy, and religion in his correspondence with Solovine, he was just as likely to express his feelings about everyday lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€his health and the effects of aging and his experiences in the various places where he settled and visited in his long career. The letters are both funny and frank, and taken together, reflect the changesÃ¢â‚¬â€large and smallÃ¢â‚¬â€that took place over a half century and in the remarkable life of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foremost scientist. Published in English alongside the German text and accompanied by facsimile copies of the original letters, the collected Letters to Solovine offers scholar and interested reader alike unprecedented access to the personal life of Albert Einstein. This authorized Philosophical Library ebook features a new introduction by Neil Berger, PhD, and an illustrated biography of Albert Einstein, which includes rare photos and never-before-seen documents from the Albert Einstein Archives at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \n\n* Out Of My Later Years: The Scientist, Philosopher, and Man Portrayed Through His Own Words (Open Road, 2011)\n\nAn inspiring collection of essays, in which Albert Einstein addresses the topics that fascinated him as a scientist, philosopher, and humanitarianDivided by subject matterÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬Å“Science,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Convictions and Beliefs,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Public Affairs,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ etc.Ã¢â‚¬â€these essays consider everything from the need for a Ã¢â‚¬Å“supranationalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ governing body to control war in the atomic age, to freedom in research and education, to Jewish history and Zionism, to explanations of the physics and scientific thought that brought him world recognition. Throughout, EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear, eloquent voice presents an idealistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision and relays complex theories to the layperson. EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s essays share his philosophical beliefs, scientific reasoning, and hopes for a brighter future, and show how one of the greatest minds of all time fully engaged with the changing world around him. This authorized Philosophical Library ebook features rare photos and never-before-seen documents from the Albert Einstein Archives at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \n\n* The Theory Of Relativity And Other Essays (Open Road, 2011)\n\nE=mc2: It may be EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most well-known contribution to modern science, but how many people understand the thought process or physics behind this famous equation?In this collection of his seven most important essays on physics, Einstein guides his reader step-by-step through the many layers of scientific theory that formed a starting point for his discoveries. By both supporting and refuting the theories and scientific efforts of his predecessors, Einstein reveals in a clear voice the origins and meaning of such significant topics as physics and reality, the fundamentals of theoretical physics, the common language of science, the laws of science and of ethics, and an elementary derivation of the equivalence of mass and energy.
