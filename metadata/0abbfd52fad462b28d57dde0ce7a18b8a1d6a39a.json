Written by Napoleon Hill and inspired by Andrew Carnegie, it was published in 1937 at the end of the Great Depression. In 1960, Hill published an abridged version of the book, which for years was the only one generally available. In 2004, Ross Cornwell published Think and Grow Rich!: The Original Version, Restored and Revised (Second Printing 2007), which restored the book to its original content, with slight revisions, and added the first comprehensive endnotes, index, and appendix the book had ever contained.\n\n\n\nUnpack with winrar and enjoy\n\n\nThis is just something I wanted to share since I D/L stuff.\n Hope someone can use it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0abbfd52fad462b28d57dde0ce7a18b8a1d6a39a","amp;dn":"Think+and+Grow-Napoleon+Hill.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0abbfd52fad462b28d57dde0ce7a18b8a1d6a39a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,187,253,82,250,212,98,178,141,87,221,224,206,122,24,184,161,214,163,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
