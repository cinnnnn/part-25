The connection is working now.  \n\nFor this edit of the Pirates of the Caribbean AWE album, I split and moved the contents of three tracks, which were noticably out of sequence. For the &quot;Singapore&quot; track, I moved its contents internally, so that the action music comes at the end of the track, and split it, so that the theme for The Black Pearl appears later in its own track, titled &quot;Closer than You Think,&quot; following &quot;Multiple Jacks.&quot;  The portion of &quot;I See Dead People in Boats&quot; that takes place while the characters are still in the land of the dead, comes before &quot;Up Is Down.&quot; The remainder of the track, renamed &quot;Part of the Crew, Part of the Ship,&quot; comes after &quot;Up is Down.&quot; The sequence of &quot;I Don&amp;#039;t Think Now is the Best Time&quot; is fixed. (For reasons I can&amp;#039;t fathom, the album producers placed the two lengthy cues that make up the track in reverse order.) The music for Will&amp;#039;s and Elizabeth&amp;#039;s action packed wedding scene now comes first. It&amp;#039;s then followed by the music for Lord Beckett meeting his end in a separate track titled &quot;It&amp;#039;s Just Good Business.&quot;\n\nI&amp;#039;ve also added a carefully amplified DVD rip of the additional end credits music and after credits scene, which follow &quot;Drink Up Me Hearties.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:662647a6cd2f6d0b47c11f0525dfd2143e5dbe95","amp;dn":"Hans+Zimmer-POTC+At+World%5C%27s+End-Film+Order+Edit+w%2FEnd+Credits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"662647a6cd2f6d0b47c11f0525dfd2143e5dbe95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,38,71,166,205,47,109,11,71,193,31,5,37,223,210,20,62,93,190,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
