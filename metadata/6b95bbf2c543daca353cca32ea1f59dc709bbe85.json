Known as the Lord Of The Mountains, he chose to defy the Church, the State and the Mafia underworld in an attempt to liberate Sicily from Italian rule and score its independence. In a land that knew only oppression and death he offered the dream of freedom and from his mountain stronghold rode along into legend. However, legendary status comes with a price as Guiliano&amp;#039;s arrogance prompts a Judas-like betrayal from his backer, Mafia Don Masino Croce.\n\nStarring:\n\nChristopher Lambert, Terence Stamp, Joss Ackland and John Turturro.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPlease Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b95bbf2c543daca353cca32ea1f59dc709bbe85","amp;dn":"The.Sicilian%5BEng%5DDvdip.Dino.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b95bbf2c543daca353cca32ea1f59dc709bbe85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,149,187,242,197,67,218,202,53,60,202,50,234,31,89,220,112,155,190,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
