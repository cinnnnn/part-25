P. Morgan and a friend of Ernest Hemingway. Living in Paris in the twenties and directing the Black Sun Press, which published James Joyce among others, Crosby was at the center of the wild life of the lost generation. Drugs, drink, sex, gambling, the deliberate derangement of the senses in the pursuit of transcendent revelation: these were Crosby's pastimes until 1929, when he shot his girlfriend, the recent bride of another man, and then himself.\n\nBlack Sun is novelist and master biographer Geoffrey Wolff's subtle and striking picture of a man who killed himself to make his life a work of art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9a4d90a4fcb1a50f6e3be4a974ea41cb1a33f3f","amp;dn":"Black+Sun%3A+The+Brief+Transit+and+Violent+Eclipse+of+Harry+Crosby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9a4d90a4fcb1a50f6e3be4a974ea41cb1a33f3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,164,217,10,79,203,26,80,246,227,190,74,151,78,164,28,177,163,63,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
