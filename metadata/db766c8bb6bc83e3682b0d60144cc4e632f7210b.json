COLORWAY significantly streamlines the iterative design workflow bringing clarity and efficiency through fast, non-destructive material and lighting changes.\n\nCOLORWAY Presenter is a free, approachable application that enables customers or colleagues to review and control 'looks' in real-time. Clients can also review and make modifications within predetermined material and lighting options.\n\nCOLORWAY kits are also free and enable users to set up, prepare, render and export scenes for COLORWAY, making it easy to tag materials or lights to be editable in COLORWAY.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœLooksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ created in COLORWAY can be imported directly back into 3D using the COLORWAY kit.\n\nWhy COLORWAY?\n\n Iterative workflow - Make almost limitless changes to your 3D scene's colors, textures, decals and even lighting set-ups. \n Realtime, GPU powered updates - Make instant changes without the need to re-render. Changes to renderings are stored independently of the source image.\n Virtual lookbook - Save multiple image variations and Ã¢â‚¬ËœlooksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, enabling clear downstream communication and design review.\n Share ideas - Send desired configurations to the free COLORWAY Presenter app. \n Finalize the image - COLORWAY Presenter lets clients iterate on images choosing from options defined in the full COLORWAY app\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease Note:\n\nSaying thanks is always good manners.\n\nIf you need help installing leave a post.\n\nOther members are welcome to leave posts to help others.\n\nI do requests so just PM me, but be patient.\n\nIf no help is forthcoming then PM me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll torrents are now mirrored on Demonoid and Kickass\n\nTorrents not registered on main search: If you download regularly from me and wish to keep up to date with my uploads then adding a RSS feed to your browser will be the fastest way... Add from here: http://www.demonoid.ph/rss/users/cadmanowl.xml or here:... Copy and paste link if the redirect on this url does not work. Alternatively copy and paste this link and bookmark for a full list: http://www.demonoid.ph/files/?uid=7677992&amp;seeded=2 or here:\n\nUploaded Torrents: All programs are checked for viruses. Some virus scanners using a HEURISTIC SCAN will report FALSE/POSITIVES on some of the fixes, most scanners will declare keygens and patchers as trojans this is due to how those files work, always scan the files yourself. If you are unsure do not use, if you are unsure but wish to try use a sandbox to test or install into a virtual machine first. All files are checked on my system by the latest versions of Comodo Firewall, NOD32 AV, and McAfee Stinger. An online scanner is available here... http://www.virustotal.com/ \n\nSeed Requests: All seed requests will be met where possible after 10 days of no seeder activity by other downloaders, after all i cannot re-seed everything with so many torrents. So members who download the torrents please try to seed inactive torrents that you have downloaded, remember it may be you next time who are waiting for seeds.\n\nMissing Torrents: Please PM me if any torrent that has been deleted through reporting it as infected, and i will see what I can do to resolve the problem.\n\nCompression and Image programs to use with the files I upload are here: http://www.demonoid.ph/files/details/2997171/7677992/\nUpdate 1 here: http://www.demonoid.ph/files/details/3031816/46067952/ and here:\n\nnfo files sometimes contain information I use Notepad++ which can be downloaded here: http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/\n\nFor more information visit the homepage: http://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/colorway/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db766c8bb6bc83e3682b0d60144cc4e632f7210b","amp;dn":"The+Foundry+Colorway+1.0+V1+Mac+OSX+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db766c8bb6bc83e3682b0d60144cc4e632f7210b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,118,108,139,182,188,131,227,104,43,13,96,20,76,196,230,50,247,33,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
