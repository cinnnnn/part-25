His persona, that of his political colleagues, his political party; the rise and combined Capitalist/Communist destruction fall of the Third Reich, have led to the publication of - at the latest count - 120,000 different titles. Virtually all of them are the preposterous re-cycled one-sided propaganda of the victors. This absence of objectivity is equalled only by the difficulty of discovering first-hand what the German Leader actually said or thought. It is as if we sit in a court room in which the defendant, defence counsel and defence witnesses have been excluded. This publication provides a rare opportunity to examine the authentic first hand expressions uttered by the German leader, who won the hearts and minds of millions of Europeans","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2764ee2a1da826d600dbacfaaf23e239cc4648b5","amp;dn":"The+Triumph+of+Reason+-+The+Thinking+Man%27s+Hitler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2764ee2a1da826d600dbacfaaf23e239cc4648b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,100,238,42,29,168,38,214,0,219,172,250,175,35,226,57,204,70,72,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
