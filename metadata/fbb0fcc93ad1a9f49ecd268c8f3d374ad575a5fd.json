Staring James Darren and Pamela Tiffin with guest appearances by Mickey Thompson and other real-life racers. \n\nCasey Owens (James Darren), a young mechanic, has developed a design for a turbine car engine, paving the way for a jet-powered auto certain to set a new land speed record. Wealthy playboy Stanford Rogers (Peter Mann) hires Casey to build the car for him to race in the Tri-State Endurance Run. Chuck Manning (Doug McClure), an engineering student Casey met in a drag race, discovers potential flaws in the car's design. After an unsuccessful test run, Rogers abandons the turbine-powered car for a traditional racing model, but Casey and Chuck rework the turbine vehicle to compete with Rogers in the endurance run. Pamela Tiffin plays Eadie, Chuck's sister who becomes Casey's love interest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbb0fcc93ad1a9f49ecd268c8f3d374ad575a5fd","amp;dn":"The+Lively+Set","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbb0fcc93ad1a9f49ecd268c8f3d374ad575a5fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,176,252,201,58,209,169,244,158,205,38,140,143,61,55,74,213,117,165,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
