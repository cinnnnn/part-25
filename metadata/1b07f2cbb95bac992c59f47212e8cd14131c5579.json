Unlike anything else I had read at the time, it was something that only a company like Comic (RIP) could have published.\n\nIt was also a &quot;sequel&quot; of sorts to &quot;The World of Ginger Fox&quot;, which can be read for free online, right here... \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.co2comics.com/pages/co2_ginger_fox_graphic_novel.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.co2comics.com/pages/co2_ginger_fox_graphic_novel.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nCover Images:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images.comics.org//img/gcd/covers_by_id/66/w400/66190.jpg?5767558948402809120&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images.comics.org//img/gcd/covers_by_id/66/w400/66190.jpg?5767558948402809120&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images.comics.org//img/gcd/covers_by_id/66/w400/66191.jpg?5767558948402809120&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images.comics.org//img/gcd/covers_by_id/66/w400/66191.jpg?5767558948402809120&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images.comics.org//img/gcd/covers_by_id/66/w400/66192.jpg?5767558948402809120&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images.comics.org//img/gcd/covers_by_id/66/w400/66192.jpg?5767558948402809120&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images.comics.org//img/gcd/covers_by_id/66/w400/66193.jpg?5767558948402809120&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images.comics.org//img/gcd/covers_by_id/66/w400/66193.jpg?5767558948402809120&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b07f2cbb95bac992c59f47212e8cd14131c5579","amp;dn":"Ginger+Fox+-+Four-Issue+Collector%27s+Series+%28Fixed+Seed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b07f2cbb95bac992c59f47212e8cd14131c5579","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,7,242,203,185,91,172,153,44,89,244,114,18,232,205,20,19,28,85,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
