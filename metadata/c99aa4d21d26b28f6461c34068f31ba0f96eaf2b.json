The last thing he expects to find back on his home turf is the love of his life....\n\n\n\nWith a make-or-break world championship on the line, professional surfer Tanner Wright has come back to the coastal California hometown he left a decade ago, carrying only his board and the painful knowledge of his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infidelity. Now that Hank Wright is dead, Tanner intends to keep the secret buried to spare his mother and sister the burden.\n\n\n\nThe last time Avalon Knox saw her best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brother, she was fourteen and he was a twenty-year-old surfer god. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never understood or respected the way Tanner distanced himself from the family that has embraced her. But now she has the professional chance of a lifetime: to photograph Tanner for the competitionÃ¢â‚¬â€if heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll agree.\n\n\n\nOut on the waves, they find in each other passion thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impossible to resist. And TannerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the only one trying to move forward from his past. As the competition heats up, secrets get spilled, and lust takes over. How close can Avalon get to this brooding surferÃ¢â‚¬Â¦without getting burned? \n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Riding the Wave is a book you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to miss! It has it all: a hot-as-hell hero and heroine, intense chemistry both in and out of the bedroom, and sharp, witty dialogue. Tanner and AvalonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story will enthrall you one minute, then tug on your heartstrings the next. I loved this book, and I think you will, too.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€New York Times Bestselling Author Deirdre Martin\nAbout the Author\nLorelei Brown has written four historical romance novels and has cowritten books in two contemporary erotic romance series under the name Kate Porter.\n\nSignet; Reissue edition | ISBN: 0451468422 | 336 pages | EPUB | July 1, 2014 | English | 0.38 Mb\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c99aa4d21d26b28f6461c34068f31ba0f96eaf2b","amp;dn":"%5BLorelie_Brown%5DRiding+the+Wave+A+Pacific+Blue+Novel%28epub%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c99aa4d21d26b28f6461c34068f31ba0f96eaf2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,154,164,210,29,38,178,143,100,97,195,64,104,243,27,160,249,110,175,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
