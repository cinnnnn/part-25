Her earthy alto possesses a raw-boned appeal that fits somewhere between Loretta Lynn and Wanda Jackson, trailing an old country and western ethos like a wagon wheel does the horse. There's plenty of pedal steel peals and rootsy strums powered by languid but sturdy rhythms, too.\n\nBut it's Shook's show: Her wavering croon sidles capably from the whiskey-fueled hook-up &quot;Follow You Home&quot; to the rockabilly-flavored stomp, &quot;Shotgun Betty.&quot; She is at her best on windswept Westerns such as &quot;Outlaw.&quot; The song keenly evokes the spirit of frontier cat houses and sodden saloons, while Shook watches her bad boy receive his rope-mediated comeuppance. Her mournful vocals are a lit fuse. She revisits this parched sway two songs later for &quot;Old Friend.&quot; This time the victim's guilty not in his application of a pistol but instead in the glass of whiskey in which he's slowly drowning. &quot;I often wonder what I would've said to you that last time we were together, or if I only knew,&quot; she sings. &quot;Dear old friend of mine, when you reach where you're heading won't you give me a sign?&quot;\n\nShook is skilled at re-creating the sinking feeling of fleeting opportunity. Even if it's a familiar sentiment, few can put words around it. Shook is fortunate that she doesn't have toÃ¢â‚¬â€it's embedded in the low, lonesome hum of her voice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57819000d5b2dddca5f1750754b36c9bfecb4a0c","amp;dn":"Sarah+Shook+%26amp%3B+The+Devil+-+Seven+%5B2013%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57819000d5b2dddca5f1750754b36c9bfecb4a0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,129,144,0,213,178,221,220,165,241,117,7,84,179,108,155,254,203,74,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
