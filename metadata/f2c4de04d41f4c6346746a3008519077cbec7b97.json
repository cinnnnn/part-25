The Fray, who exploded into worldwide success \nwith that album, have captured the skilled songwriting that broke them and, \nwith the help of acclaimed producers Mike Flynn and Aaron Johnson, created a \nset of songs sure to make them household names. The band continues their \nlicensing success story by collaborating with ABC's hit show, Lost in a \nseries of music video promos featuring the album's first single, 'You Found \nMe' for the newest season of the show. The spots also ran during the 2008 \nAmerican Music Awards, where the band was a featured performer. Over the \nweekend of the release and performance, the Lost video had over one million \nviews. 10 tracks. \n\nEnjoy another steaming pile of mainstream feces for your listening pleasure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2c4de04d41f4c6346746a3008519077cbec7b97","amp;dn":"The+Fray+-+2009-DelacroixXIII","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2c4de04d41f4c6346746a3008519077cbec7b97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,196,222,4,212,31,76,99,70,116,106,48,8,81,144,119,203,236,123,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
