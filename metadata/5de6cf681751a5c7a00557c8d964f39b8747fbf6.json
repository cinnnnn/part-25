But individuals should realize that investing doesn't have to be a gamble. They can avoid the next Enron before it happens by learning to be their own most-trusted financial advisor. Reading Between the Lies gives investors all the information they need to begin the self-education process. The book examines today's financial markets and discusses how they have been abused, touching but not dwelling on such infamous cases as Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, and Adelphia. It explains how to dig into company financial records to find valuable investing information, and shows how to turn this research into an action plan for safer, profitable investing. Reading Between the Lies is written by Jordan Goodman, a well-known financial consumer advocate, and includes a foreword and insightful commentary throughout by Robert Olstein, one of the country's most respected value fund managers and chairman of Olstein Associates, LP, advisor and distributor of The Olstein Financial Alert Fund. Inside, readers will learn: *An overview of corporations that recently abused the system and how they did it *How audits are conducted and why they can be a problem *Why it's important for investors to perform their own company financial evaluations *How to assess data on balance sheets and other financial reports to determine a company's potential *How to look beyond fundamentals and evaluate such things as technical indicators and management profiles *Where to look online for financial information and how to apply it intelligently Reading Between the Lies is a must-read for anyone who wants to invest with confidence. The book teaches investors how to spot bad news before it happens, avoid scandal, and profit from the truth.\nAbout the AuthJordan E.
