He journeys to his old village looking for peace, but is pursued by the brother of Boss Kanbei, a man he's killed. Back home, Ichi connects with Banno, his teacher, who seeks prestige and has arranged for his younger sister, Yayoi, to marry into a wealthy samurai family. Ichi and Yayoi realize they are in love, but Ichi's request for her hand meets with Banno's derision. Ichi is also drawn into Banno's plot to kidnap the son of a wealthy man, ostensibly to aid the Mito Goblins, a gang of thieves on the run; but Banno wants to keep the ransom. Ichi wants harmony and love, but can he escape a destiny of violence?\n\nDirector: TokuzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ Tanaka\nWriters: Minoru Inuzuka, Kan Shimosawa (story)\nStars: ShintarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ Katsu, Mikiko Tsubouchi and SeizaburÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ Kawazu\nGenre: Action | Drama\nLanguage: Japanese\nSubtitle: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07654c9cfab0c3e58b2cca3ff7315c7b7ee8c6ab","amp;dn":"New+Tale+of+Zatoichi+%281963%29%5B03%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07654c9cfab0c3e58b2cca3ff7315c7b7ee8c6ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,101,76,156,250,176,195,229,139,44,202,63,247,49,92,123,126,232,198,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
