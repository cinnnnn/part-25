The band advocates nonconformism and iconoclasm, often utilizing controversial imagery and lyrical content. It is difficult to categorize the band, however, as each album thus far has had a distinct and individual sound, and the band and frontman endeavor to devise and use a unique image and aesthetic for each album's era. The band was formed in 1989 as Marilyn Manson &amp; the Spooky Kids. The band's uniquely theatrical performances gathered a local cult following that subsequently developed into a worldwide fanbase. The band's lineup almost always changes between album releases. The current members of the band are the eponymous lead singer Marilyn Manson, bassist Twiggy Ramirez, drummer Ginger Fish and keyboardist Chris Vrenna.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78cb3e2f253f6898a0d7034f55fc0c12b12256c6","amp;dn":"Marilyn+Manson+-+Tainted+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78cb3e2f253f6898a0d7034f55fc0c12b12256c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,203,62,47,37,63,104,152,160,215,3,79,85,252,12,18,177,34,86,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
