Moreover, Bleecker coauthored with Bruce's window Linda Lee The Bruce Lee Story, which served as the source material for MCA Universal's motion picture Dragon.\n\nUnsettled Matters is the result of over four years of intense investigative research that led the author from the back alleys of Hong Kong to obscure court documents uncovered in Los Angeles and Seattle. Learn the shocking truth about the life and death of martial arts icon Bruce Lee. Discover why both the author and this publication company have been threatened with massive civil lawsuits if we dare publish the contents of this book.
