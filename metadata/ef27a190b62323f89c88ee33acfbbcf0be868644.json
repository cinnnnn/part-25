Both have undergone processes of\nfission and fusion, with research areas branching out into subfields, and two or more\nuniting to create new fields of research. The history of science, initially practiced by\nhistorians, philosophers, and retired scientists, now attracts social historians, sociologists,\nanthropologists, historians of religion and of technology, and literary historians. It has\ncome to embrace biographies of scientists; the histories of scientific disciplines and their\nbranches; scientific institutions; the analysis and development of broad concepts such as\nmatter, motion, and life; the support of scientific activities; the philosophical foundations\nand implications of science; the relation of science to fields such as medicine and\ntechnology; and the social contexts within which scientific ideas and practices emerged.\nThe expertise required for the creation of an encyclopedia as complex as one on the\nScientific Revolution led to the recruitment of more than 160 contributors from fourteen\ncountries. The 441 articles, however, were designed to appeal to a wide readership. A\nuserÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s guide has been provided as an aid for the reader in finding his or her way in the\nsubject matter of the encyclopedia as a whole, and a number of entries on various\nhistoriographical approaches to the history of science are included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef27a190b62323f89c88ee33acfbbcf0be868644","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+the+Scientific+Revolution+From+Copernicus+to+New","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef27a190b62323f89c88ee33acfbbcf0be868644","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,39,161,144,182,35,35,248,156,136,238,51,172,251,188,240,190,134,134,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
