While arch traditionalists Welch and Rawlings would hardly seem like a likely match for alt-country's bad boy, the collaboration brought out the best in Adams; Heartbreaker is loose, open, and heartfelt in a way Whiskeytown's admittedly fine albums never were, and makes as strong a case for Adams' gifts as anything his band ever released. With the exception of the Stones-flavored &quot;Shakedown on 9th Street&quot; and the swaggering &quot;To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, Is to Be High),&quot; Heartbreaker leaves rock &amp; roll on the shelf in favor of a sound that blends low-key folk-rock with a rootsy, bluegrass-accented undertow, and while the album's production and arrangements are subtle and spare, they make up in emotional impact whatever they lack in volume. As a songwriter, Adams concerns himself with the ups and downs of romance rather than the post-teenage angst that dominated Whiskeytown's work, and &quot;My Winding Wheel&quot; and &quot;Damn, Sam (I Love a Woman That Rains)&quot; are warmly optimistic in a way he's rarely been before, while &quot;Come Pick Me Up&quot; shows he's still eloquently in touch with heartbreak. Adams has always been a strong vocalist, but his duet with Emmylou Harris on &quot;Oh My Sweet Carolina&quot; may well be his finest hour as a singer, and the stripped-back sound of these sessions allows him to explore the nooks and crannies of his voice, and the results are pleasing. Whiskeytown fans who loved the &quot;Replacements-go-twang&quot; crunch of &quot;Drank Like a River&quot; and &quot;Yesterday's News&quot; might have a hard time warming up to Heartbreaker, but the strength of the material and the performances suggest Adams is finally gaining some much-needed maturity, and his music is all the better for it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c1f1edcf96df7a34557952e5476ec5b7e6d2a3e","amp;dn":"Ryan+Adams+-+Heartbreaker+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c1f1edcf96df7a34557952e5476ec5b7e6d2a3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,31,30,220,249,109,247,163,69,87,149,46,84,118,236,91,126,109,42,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
