This set improves upon the CD issue by Ember with eight additional cuts and far better sound. The tunes -- with arrangements by saxophonist Frank Foster, Neal Hefti, Jimmy Mundy, Quincy Jones, Benny Carter, and others -- are a mix of vocal cuts with guests such as Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross, Tony Bennett, Irene Reid, Sarah Vaughan, and (of course) the band's own singer, Joe Williams. Whether it's a duet like &quot;Teach Me Tonight&quot; between Vaughan and Williams, Billy Eckstine singing &quot;Lonesome Lover Blues&quot; and Ben Webster soloing on the same tune, Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross vocalizing on &quot;Jumping at the Woodside,&quot; or the burning version of &quot;April in Paris&quot; recorded live in Sweden with an arrangement by Wild Bill Davis, this set cooks from top to bottom and is an excellent -- even stellar -- view of the Basie orchestra during a very creative and fertile period.
