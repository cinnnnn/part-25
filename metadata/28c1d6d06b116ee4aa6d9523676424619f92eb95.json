Branco was originally drawn to jazz and forms of Portuguese music before finally opting for fado after being introduced to the music of AmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lia Rodrigues by her grandfather. Branco studied the poems from which major fado lyrics are taken. Branco continues to work on her fado repertory, accompanied by CustÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³dio Castelo on guitar and as composer.\n\n18 May 2011 on stage at the Cigale in Paris, Cristina Branco will start a whole new French tour presenting her new album &quot;Fado, Tango.&quot; Sung in Portuguese, French and Spanish, &quot;Fado, Tango&quot; was recorded in Lisbon, from verses of poets Manuela de Freitas, AntÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³nio Lobo Antunes, Vasco GraÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a Moura, Carlos TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âª and Miguel Farias. With music by Mario Laginha, JoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Paulo Esteves da Silva and Pedro Moreira; album also contains songs by Jacques Brel, Carlos Gardel and Isolina Carrillo. And a beautiful musical setting of a poem by Charles Baudelaire's &quot;Invitation au voyage&quot;, &quot;Nao Se Chovesse (Fado Suplica)&quot;, in the purest tradition of fado.\n\nTRACKS\n01.- Se Nao Chovesse - Fado sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºplica 3:26\n02.- Anclao en ParÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­s 2:01\n03.- Um Amor 4:30\n04.- L'invitacion au Voyage 3:11\n05.- Nao hÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ tangos em Paris 3:27\n06.- CanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ao de amor e piedade 4:30\n07.- Les DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sespÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s 3:45\n08.- A Laurindinha 3:35\n09.- Dos Gardenias 2:24\n10.- Quando Julgas Que me Amas 3:21\n11.- Serenata 2:57\n12.- Reflexao Total 3:40\n13.- Talvez 4:56\n14.- Sete (Instrumental) 1:25\n15.- Nao ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© DesgraÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a Ser Pobre - Fado Menor 3:50\n16.- SoluÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§o 2:27","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28c1d6d06b116ee4aa6d9523676424619f92eb95","amp;dn":"Cristina+Branco+-+Fado+Tango+%28320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28c1d6d06b116ee4aa6d9523676424619f92eb95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,193,214,208,107,17,110,228,170,109,149,35,103,100,36,97,159,146,235,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
