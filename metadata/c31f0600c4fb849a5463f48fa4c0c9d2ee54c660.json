Once done there, you would set sail to the Pacific Islands to bask under palm trees, watching sap being drawn from the coconut palms to create coconut vinegar.\nYour travels would involve a trip to Asia ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to China for exotic oriental dishes, to Japan to eat as much sushi as you could, and to Korea to sample its kimchee, the vinegar pickle that accompanies every meal. Heading to the UK, you could finally put your feet up and tuck into the old favourite of fish and chips with a helping of malt vinegar or non brewed condiment.\nWhile a world trip is not possible for most of us, this book offers you plenty of food for thought about vinegar, examining the many different types available, how each is\nmade and where they can best be used, with recipes included. It traces the history of the condiment ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as far as possible, since this universal ingredient seems to have existed always, with no known ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“inventorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to quote. It will provide you with a wealth of practical tips concerning its versatility as a cleaning, beauty, gardening and medicinalaid as well as many more uses. And if that is not enough, you can always put yourself ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“in a pickleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ by learning the principles and properties of vinegar as a preservative.\nThe only question that remains is what vinegar can not do. If it were not corrosive to metal, we would probably be fuelling our cars with it in an environmentally friendly mixture of energy-releasing bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) and vinegar.\nMeanwhile, there is plenty of scope for educational projects around the home, some of them using that exact same concoction.So enjoy the many, many properties of vinegar in all its forms and uses, and keep that world trip in mind for another day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c31f0600c4fb849a5463f48fa4c0c9d2ee54c660","amp;dn":"Vinegar++A+Guide+to+the+Many+Types+and+Their+Uses+Around+the+Hom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c31f0600c4fb849a5463f48fa4c0c9d2ee54c660","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,31,6,0,196,251,132,154,84,99,244,143,164,192,201,210,238,84,198,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
