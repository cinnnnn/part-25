Out on the gridiron, Gerald R. Ford High School students Shawn Colfax (D'Agosto) and Nick Brady (Olsen) are star players. But summer is drawing near, and this year neither Shawn nor Nick can stomach the prospect of spending their sun-soaked months lunging at tackling dummies and getting berated by their coach. Fortunately, Nick has a brilliant solution to their current dilemma: sign up for cheerleading camp and spend the summer surrounded by gorgeous women. But head cheerleader Carly (Sarah Roemer) can see right through them, and when Shawn falls head over heels for her, their genius plan hits an unexpected hitch. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 30 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeee1eea0e10b113bfcb27228a8eb129f38041af","amp;dn":"Fired+Up%282009%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeee1eea0e10b113bfcb27228a8eb129f38041af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,238,30,234,14,16,177,19,191,203,39,34,138,142,177,41,243,128,65,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
