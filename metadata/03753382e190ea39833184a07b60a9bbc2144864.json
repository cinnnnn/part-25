This historic album put The Band in the mainstream consciousness and remains a timeless classic. The Band was recently inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and this is the album that put them there. Their influence on the music scene started as the backup band for Bob Dylan on his 1965-66 world tour and when they started recording on their own with a contract from Capitol Records, this, their second album, was the top of their creative spark. The album features, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUp On Cripple CreekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Night They Drove Old Dixie DownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKing HarvestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRag Mama RagÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and many more including the Bonus Track, &quot;Get Up Jake&quot;. Mastered for Audio Fidelity 24 Karat Gold from the analog Capitol master mixes by Steve Hoffman.\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ\tOne of my favorite albums and one of The Band's best, their self titled second album sounds terrific in this remaster. The sound stage, dynamics and detail that are often missing from &quot;modern&quot; remasters are all here. Audio Fidelity has done a nice job with this reissue and Steve Hoffman's remaster nicely captures the warmth of the original recording and Hoffman uses the original master tape for the first time since the original pressing of the album (let's just say that one band member has had it all this time and wouldn't give it up).\n\nThe big difference between this and the previous reissue aside from the master being used for the first time in years is that this has only the original 12 tracks for the album plus &quot;Get Up Jake&quot; an outtake from the sessions that should have been on the original album. The outtakes that were on the reissue of the album aren't here but that's a small issue for me as this album has never sounded this good on compact disc before.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n1.
