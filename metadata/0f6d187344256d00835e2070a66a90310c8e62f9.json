This dynamic original series dramatizes the final hour leading up to several pivotal historical events. Here we experience history just before it became history.Using a real-time clock and a split-screen to follow key players, the series reveals the chilling lead-up to events that changed the world including the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown, 9/11 and the Columbine shooting.\n\n\n\n\nEpisode 5 : The Capture of Saddam Hussein \n\nEight months after the fall of Baghdad, on 13th December 2003, U.S. Special Forces launched Operation Red Dawn just nine miles from Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, resulting in the infamous capture of the fugitive dictator.\n\nThis episode of the compelling Zero Hour series reconstructs the final hour of this raid based on the previously unknown testimony of Samir, an Iraqi Shia Muslim, who was acting as a translator for the US special-forces and who helped pull Saddam from his final hiding place.\n\nIt is a particularly personal and poignant viewpoint from a man driven from his country 12 years previously by Saddam's regime, but who returned and extracted his revenge.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2242 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x464\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.552:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 46:41.640\nNumber Of Parts: 10\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f6d187344256d00835e2070a66a90310c8e62f9","amp;dn":"DC.Zero.Hour.05of10.The.Capture.of.Saddam.Hussein.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f6d187344256d00835e2070a66a90310c8e62f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,109,24,115,68,37,109,0,131,94,32,112,166,106,144,49,12,142,98,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
