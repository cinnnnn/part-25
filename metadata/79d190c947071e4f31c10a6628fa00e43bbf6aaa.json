So I guess it is now obsolete.  I am beginning to think that maybe Norm didn&amp;#039;t like his 1999 season.  However, as usual, Norm produces one good show.  It is in avi format, from a british source. If you like it, be sure to buy other tapes/dvd/plans from Norm at newyankee.com \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79d190c947071e4f31c10a6628fa00e43bbf6aaa","amp;dn":"New+Yankee+Workshop+-+1999+Season+Episode+5+-+Teak+Bar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79d190c947071e4f31c10a6628fa00e43bbf6aaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,209,144,201,71,7,30,79,49,193,10,102,40,250,0,228,59,191,106,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
