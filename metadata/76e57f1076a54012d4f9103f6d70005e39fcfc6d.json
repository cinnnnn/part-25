The lists are renumbered and may contain some minor corrections.\n\nI used this opportunity to make a small change by keeping the type of list within the title and change this number into a bit more logical order. The type of lists are:\n\n1 = Soft Pop and Folk, top sound quality.\n2 = A mix of Rock and Pop, a bit more extreme and little less sound quality\n3 = Electronic, varying from chill to Rock\n4 = Solid Rock\n5 = Garage Rock and Dance\n\nNot being real playlists, the unsorted (I9) lists are not included and only downloadable from the monthly uploads.\n\nEnjoy:\n\nI106 1 Joy\nI107 2 Habits\nI108 1 We Both Know\nI109 1 Beautiful Anyway\nI110 2 Luminous Blue\nI111 2 Issues\nI112 2 Safe Side\nI113 2 Token\nI114 2 Go Slow\nI115 2 Dancing Alive\nI116 2 Lifeforms\nI117 2 Rich\nI118 2 Staying Up\nI119 2 Wishes\nI120 3 Hypnotise Me\nI121 3 Footprints\nI122 3 Let Go\nI123 3 The Departed\nI124 3 Need U\nI125 4 I Found You\nI126 4 Dancing Shoes\nI127 4 You Know Me\nI128 4 Here's To Us\nI129 5 Hey Love\nI130 5 Golden Touch\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76e57f1076a54012d4f9103f6d70005e39fcfc6d","amp;dn":"Dutch+Treat+Indie+Playlists+I+106-130+%28HQ+VBR+MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76e57f1076a54012d4f9103f6d70005e39fcfc6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,229,127,16,118,165,64,18,212,249,16,63,109,112,0,94,57,252,252,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
