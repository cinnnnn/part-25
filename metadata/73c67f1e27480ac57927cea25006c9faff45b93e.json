Those without a DTS-MA receiver will still be able to play a 24/48 core DTS stream.\n\nFor those who cannot play a disc in AVCHD, there is brief document included in this torrent as to my own process in extracting mono wavs from discs like these in order to create a disc in another multichannel format.\n\nNotes and disclaimers:\n\nIt is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.\n\nIf you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.\n\nNot music I was ever overly-familiar with, but I was given the suggestion to try converting &quot;I'm Not in Love&quot; to 5.1 and loved the results. Learned about a pretty interesting album in the process. Loads of surround goodies here.\n\nTrack listing:\n\nOne Nuit A Paris\nI'm Not In Love\nBlackmail\nThe Second Sitting For The Last Supper\nBrand New Day\nFlying Junk\nLife Is A Minestrone\nThe Film Of My Love\n\nEnjoy.\n\nDKA\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73c67f1e27480ac57927cea25006c9faff45b93e","amp;dn":"10cc+-+The+Original+Soundtrack+%28SPEC+DTS-MA+5.1+by+DKA%29+%28SBU%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73c67f1e27480ac57927cea25006c9faff45b93e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,198,127,30,39,72,10,197,121,39,206,162,80,6,201,250,255,69,185,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
