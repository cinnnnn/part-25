To reduce certain\nsinusoidal frequency components in a signal in amplitude, digital filtering\nis done. One may want to obtain the integral of a signal. If the signal\ncomes from a tachometer, the integral gives the position. If the signal is\nnoisy, then filtering the signal to reduce the amplitudes of the noise\nfrequencies improves signal quality. For example, noise may occur from\nwind or rain at an outdoor music presentation. F iltering out sinusoidal\ncomponents of the signal that occur at frequencies that cannot be\nproduced by the music itself results in recording the music with little wind\nand rain noise. Sometimes the signal is corrupted not by noise, but by\nother signal frequencies that are of no present interest. If the signal is an\nelectronic measurement of a brain wave obtained by using probes applied\nexternally to the head, other electronic signals are picked up by the\nprobes, but the physician may be interested only in signals occurring at a\nparticular frequency. By using digital filtering, the signals of interest only\ncan be presented to the physician.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:701eb6af26032b493ca906b26d83d022276c72e5","amp;dn":"Digital+Signal+Processing+Filtering+Approach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"701eb6af26032b493ca906b26d83d022276c72e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,30,182,175,38,3,43,73,60,169,6,178,109,131,208,34,39,108,114,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
