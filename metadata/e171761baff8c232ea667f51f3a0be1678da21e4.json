They then get into the Ray Rice video, hear Bernard McGuirk's take on the situation, discuss violence in relationships, and chat with some callers. Jim talks about his Time.com article and how the media uses people to keep stories going, the guys have a discussion about ISIS and their propaganda, camel toes, and we endure a few more listener calls. They then get into &quot;oldie time movies,&quot; talk Hitler, the new iPhone 6 Plus, Bailey Jay, and Craig's conundrums. They wrap up talking about &quot;Classic Moments in Cinema with Colin Quinn,&quot; Boardwalk Empire, and Joan Rivers. And yes, the show is also riddled with plenty of Chip and Edgar bombs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e171761baff8c232ea667f51f3a0be1678da21e4","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-09-09+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e171761baff8c232ea667f51f3a0be1678da21e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,113,118,27,175,248,194,50,234,102,127,81,243,160,190,22,120,218,33,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
