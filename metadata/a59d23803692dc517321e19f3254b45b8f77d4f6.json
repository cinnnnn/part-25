This Roger Corman quickie is pretty good throughout, although the film really doesn't offer anything new the to the genre. The movie moves at a pretty fast pace and contains plenty of action to keep fans entertained. The most interesting thing about watching this movie today is seeing the young Bronson give a performance, which he certainly wouldn't give after becoming a star. If you've only seen Bronson's later day stuff then you're in for a treat as we see a different type of Bronson here. A fast talker, one that smiles and even one who flirts with the ladies. This adds a little more charm to the film that I'm sure it didn't have back when it was originally released. Susan Cabot is very good as Bronson's girlfriend, a dirty little girl who doesn't mind looking at other men. The action is very good throughout and the film has a great music score but I wish it had tried something a little different every once in a while. The best moments in the film are the ones with Bronson messing with a caged lion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a59d23803692dc517321e19f3254b45b8f77d4f6","amp;dn":"Machine+Gun+Kelly+%28Charles+Bronson%29+%5B1958%5D+%40%21+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a59d23803692dc517321e19f3254b45b8f77d4f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,157,35,128,54,146,220,81,115,33,225,159,50,84,180,91,143,119,212,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
