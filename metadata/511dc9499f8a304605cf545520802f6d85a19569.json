In between the footage of Messrs. St. Hubbins, Tufnel, and Smalls performing in front of a huge crowd enthusiastically determined to go along with the joke, there are clips purporting to investigate the band's humble origins in the East London suburb of Squatney, and updates from &quot;rockumentary&quot; director Marty DiBergi and hapless record plugger Artie Fufkin from the original movie. It is the latter component that is the real strength of Return. Though the concert footage faithfully rehashes many of the film's most treasured jokes (the malfunctioning props, the dancing midgets), the real satirical strength of This Is Spinal Tap was never its treatment of heavy metal music (which, after all, is hardly a difficult target). What the first movie did best was illuminate the egomania, paranoia, delusion, and stupidity that are the cornerstones of rock &amp; roll as it is lived. The Return of Spinal Tap is a worthy companion piece. --Andrew Mueller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:511dc9499f8a304605cf545520802f6d85a19569","amp;dn":"The+Return+of+Spinal+Tap","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"511dc9499f8a304605cf545520802f6d85a19569","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,29,201,73,159,138,48,70,5,207,84,85,32,128,47,109,133,161,149,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
