Fox, Lou Pearlman, and Blake Shelton. Andi Gutierrez Skypes in to talk about all things Star Wars and play a game, Dave goes on to berate Roy for his Star Wars playing skills, he berates Flutesy for her evening, and the guys sing us a sweet song. We hear from Shock Jock Robot, Dave gets some gifts, we watch reaction videos, they make their own reaction video, and they sing out this real fine day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea04bebddf2f7acfce9a548e8fc1cdb7e4894fd8","amp;dn":"East+Side+Dave+Show+2016-08-23+%28Andi+Gutierrez%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea04bebddf2f7acfce9a548e8fc1cdb7e4894fd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,4,190,189,223,47,122,207,206,154,84,142,143,193,205,183,228,137,79,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
