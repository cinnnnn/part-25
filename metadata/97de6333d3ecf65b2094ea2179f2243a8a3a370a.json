They are perhaps best remembered for their five biggest songs &quot;My Girl (Gone Gone Gone)&quot;, &quot;I Believe&quot;, &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do&quot;, &quot;Fly At Night&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Mary&quot;. The band's lineup has changed numerous times, though Bill Henderson has constantly remained a fixture, and Chilliwack continues to tour across Canada. \n\n\n\nGreatest Hits 1988\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits is a greatest hits album by the Canadian rock band Chilliwack originally released in 1994. The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thirteen tracks, arranged in a backwards-chronological sequence, include the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most notable releases between the years 1969 and 1984 (and is, in fact, identical to the track listing of their album Segue). Allmusic rated Greatest Hits with four-and-a-half stars, calling the album &quot;a truly solid package&quot; and &quot;a sincerely delightful collection.&quot;\n\nIn 2002, Greatest Hits was digitally remastered by Peter J. Moore using Sonic Solutions NoNoise Technology. The re-released compilation includes an eleven-page booklet recounting the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history. Also included on the remastered CD are the original full-length videos for &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do&quot; and &quot;My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)&quot;, which can be played on Windows Media Player.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Don't Stop&quot; (Mulford/Henderson) (4:01)\n2.\t&quot;Getting Better&quot; (Henderson/Mulford) (3:43)\n3.\t&quot;Whatcha Gonna Do&quot; (Henderson/MacLeod) (4:16)\n4.\t&quot;My Girl (Gone Gone Gone)&quot; (Henderson/MacLeod) (4:15)\n5.\t&quot;I Believe&quot; (Henderson) (3:58)\n6.\t&quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; (Henderson) (2:24)\n7.\t&quot;Arms of Mary&quot; (Sutherland) (3:04)\n8.\t&quot;Fly at Night&quot; (Henderson/Turney) (4:54)\n9.\t&quot;Baby Blue&quot; (Henderson/Turney) (3:21)\n10.\t&quot;California Girl&quot; (Henderson) (3:01)\n11.\t&quot;Crazy Talk&quot; (Henderson) (3:07)\n12.\t&quot;Lonesome Mary&quot; (Henderson) (3:02)\n13.\t&quot;Raino&quot; (Henderson) (4:27)\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97de6333d3ecf65b2094ea2179f2243a8a3a370a","amp;dn":"Chilliwack+-+Greatest+Hits+1988+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97de6333d3ecf65b2094ea2179f2243a8a3a370a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,222,99,51,211,236,246,91,32,148,234,33,121,242,36,58,138,58,55,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
