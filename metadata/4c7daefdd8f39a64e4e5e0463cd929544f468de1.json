As part of her life's work, she comforts families who have tragically lost children, helps authorities find dangerous criminals, and locates missing persons.\n\nIn Secrets of the Monarch, Allison shares important life lessons she's learned through communicating with the dead. She explores the legacies we leave and shows how her experiences with the other side have helped her to learn the secret to living a happy life while ensuring her children and grandchildren will too. Like the monarch butterfly, whose survival as a species depends on its predecessors' actions, we can live good lives to ensure the happiness of future generations. With insightful teachings on both family relationships and friendships, as well as how she herself is inspired to live better tomorrow than she has today, Allison DuBois shows how each of us can make our lives a true masterpiece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c7daefdd8f39a64e4e5e0463cd929544f468de1","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+the+Monarch-ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c7daefdd8f39a64e4e5e0463cd929544f468de1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,125,174,253,216,243,154,100,228,229,224,70,60,217,41,84,79,70,141,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
