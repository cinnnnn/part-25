RegÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adventure is tempered by original and thought-provoking ruminations on the southern issues of race, pride and identity. A beautiful, original and hot evocation of the cradle of American music.\n\nEpisode 1 of 3: Tennessee and Kentucky\n\n[justify]In the first of a three-part road trip, Georgia-born but London-based Reginald D Hunter returns home to explore the American south both past and present through its world-famous songs. Reg begins by exploring the sounds of Kentucky and Tennessee and the disturbing tradition of blackface minstrelsy.\n\nHunter is led through the south by its signature songs, including Dolly Parton's My Tennessee Mountain Home, Knoxville Girl, Blue Moon of Kentucky, Chattanooga Choo Choo and minstrel songs such as My Ol' Kentucky Home and Old Folks at Home.\n\nOn his voyage Reg visits Dollywood, a slave plantation in Bardstown, Nashville - the home of country music, a moonshine distillery in Gatlinburg and a string band festival in Mount Airy.\n\nFeaturing Dolly Parton, the Handsome Family and Del McCoury.\n\n===================================================================================\nSource.......: HDTV\nSize.........: 329MB\nFormat.......: mp4\nResolution...: 640x360\nVideo........: h.264, 700Kbps @ 25 fps\nAudio........: aac, 93Kbps, 48 KHz, 2 channels\n===================================================================================\n\nghost dog","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:530289a4053703c3c726a2ae6d6fab29da2aebf4","amp;dn":"Songs+of+the+South+-+1.+Tennessee+and+Kentucky+HDTV+x264+-+GHOST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"530289a4053703c3c726a2ae6d6fab29da2aebf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,2,137,164,5,55,3,195,199,38,162,174,109,111,171,41,218,42,235,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
