(Springer, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-3-319-12867-2\r\n\r\nThis book addresses a broad spectrum of areas in both hybrid materials and hierarchical composites, including recent development of processing technologies, structural designs, modern computer simulation techniques, and the relationships between the processing-structure-property-performance. Each topic is introduced at length with numerous and detailed examples and over 150 illustrations. In addition, the authors present a method of categorizing these materials, so that representative examples of all material classes are discussed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98645f50718115346261888a9e87a634a925d490","amp;dn":"Hybrid+and+Hierarchical+Composite+Materials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98645f50718115346261888a9e87a634a925d490","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,100,95,80,113,129,21,52,98,97,136,138,158,135,166,52,169,37,212,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
