As a team, their individual skills combined make them invincible: Sora, with his astute intuition and penetrating insight; and Shiro, with her remarkable intellect that goes beyond prodigy-level genius. In the real world, they are reclusive and unsocial hikikomori, but in the game world, the siblings together form Ã£â‚¬Å½Ã£â‚¬â‚¬Ã£â‚¬â‚¬Ã£â‚¬ï¿½ (a blank space), a mysterious group of undefeated online gamers who win every game they play with unbeatable scores. Because the account names of the players are always left empty, they become simply known as &quot;Blank&quot;.\n\nOne fateful day, after beating a mysterious challenger in a game of online chess, the siblings receive an offer from their opponent to be reborn in his world, a world where everything is determined by games. The siblings, weary of their world, accept his proposal and are transported to the fantasy world of Disboard (Ã§â€ºÂ¤Ã¤Â¸Å Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã¤Â¸â€“Ã§â€¢Å’Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã£Æ’â€¡Ã£â€šÂ£Ã£â€šÂ¹Ã£Æ’Å“Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’â€°Ã¯Â¼â€° DisubÃ…ï¿½do) by Tet, the world's last remaining God and also their former opponent.
