Haunted by memories of Billy, Garrett wanders the New Mexico desert in a fruitless pursuit of peace.\n\nDeep in the same desert, an ancient Spanish alchemist searches for the fabled philosopher's stone. Resolutely alone in his quest he devotes his long life to hunting the secrets of the old gods.\n\nAs these two men seek answers to questions that have confounded mankind for centuries, their stories encompass the panorama of American history. This journey from wild frontier into the twentieth century is an unforgettable experience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:657c8aed1d22b18ea85a9eef8bee188995a184ed","amp;dn":"Loren+D.+Estleman-Journey+of+the+Dead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"657c8aed1d22b18ea85a9eef8bee188995a184ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,124,138,237,29,34,177,142,168,90,158,239,139,238,24,137,149,161,132,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
