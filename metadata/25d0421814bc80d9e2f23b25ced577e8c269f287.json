Told from their candid, sometimes hilarious perspectives, these kids are transformed, from reluctant participants to determined competitors, from typical urban kids to &quot;ladies and gentlemen,&quot; on their way to try to compete in the final citywide competition. Providing unique insight into the incredible cultural diversity that is New York City, this film profiles several kids from three schools (out of 60) at this dynamic age, when becoming that &quot;cool&quot; teenager vies for position with familiar innocence, while they learn the merengue, rumba, tango, the foxtrot and swing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25d0421814bc80d9e2f23b25ced577e8c269f287","amp;dn":"Mad+Hot+Ballroom+DVDRip+NTSC+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25d0421814bc80d9e2f23b25ced577e8c269f287","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,208,66,24,20,188,128,217,226,242,59,37,206,213,119,232,194,105,242,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
