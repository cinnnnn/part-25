For those who prefer flac files, converting from ape is no problem: lossless --&gt; lossless = lossless. Most media players will do this, I use MediaMonkey. Standalone converters exist, also.I use xrecode. Any computer from the last 5 years can convert to the format of your choice in a matter of minutes (or less) for each CD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c37764e40130aedf72747391e10df89a01c198db","amp;dn":"Mercury+Living+Presence+Collection+%281-10%29+%5Bape%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c37764e40130aedf72747391e10df89a01c198db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,119,100,228,1,48,174,223,114,116,115,145,225,13,248,154,1,193,152,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
