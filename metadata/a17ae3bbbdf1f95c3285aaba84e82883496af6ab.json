While fleeing from two of the vicious Bandar-Loo -- the jungle's despised monkey people, played by two mangy and pretty scary-looking chimpanzees -- Mowgli comes to the attention of Harrison (Bill Campbell), a scout for P.T. Barnum, who decides to capture the &quot;wolf boy&quot; for the circus. He teams up with the wealthy, evil Buldeo (Gulshan Grover), whose late brother was Mowgli's father, and the very scary Karait (Dyrk Ashton), whose python is enlisted to track the boy down. They're joined by Chuchundra (David Paul Francis), a good-natured buffoon whose tame monkey has escaped to the jungle with the wild child. The chase culminates in an eerie lost city populated by monkeys and presided over by a mad soldier (Roddy McDowall), where Mowgli's animal friends come to his rescue. Though the proceedings have a distinctly low-rent look, the lush Sri Lankan locations and extensive footage of animals -- including a tiger, elephants, miscellaneous snakes, a panther, wolves, a sun bear and lots of monkeys (nothing bad happens to any of the animals) -- could make this appealing to a certain kind of child. The adult performances are very broad, but young Jamie Williams has a pretty good repertory of animal noises at his disposal. \n\n\nGspot Info~&gt;AVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: The Second Jungle Book Mowgli &amp; Baloo (1997)[Tabsman DVDRIP][H33T][Release].avi\nFilesize.....: 701 MB (or 717,916 KB or 735,145,984 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:29:32 (128,808 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 962 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \nFrame Size...: 512x384 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\n\nSubs~&gt;NO\nTracker~&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a17ae3bbbdf1f95c3285aaba84e82883496af6ab","amp;dn":"The+Second+Jungle+Book+Mowgli+%26+Baloo+%281997%29%5BTabsman+DVDRIP%5D%5BH33","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a17ae3bbbdf1f95c3285aaba84e82883496af6ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,122,227,187,189,241,249,92,50,133,170,186,132,232,40,131,73,106,246,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
