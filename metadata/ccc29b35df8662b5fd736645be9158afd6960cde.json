This is the (relatively hard to find) 2004 reissue of Modest Mouse's highly acclaimed 'The Moon &amp; Antarctica'. The bands lead singer and guitarist, Isaac Brock, was un-pleased with the original mastering of the album. He intended to use his own money to remix it for his personal listening, but when Epic offered to fund it, he reissued the album along with 4 Radio BBC live sessions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccc29b35df8662b5fd736645be9158afd6960cde","amp;dn":"The+Moon+%26amp%3B+Antarctice+%282004+Reissue%29+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccc29b35df8662b5fd736645be9158afd6960cde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,194,155,53,223,134,98,181,253,115,102,69,190,145,88,175,214,150,12,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
