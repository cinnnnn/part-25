There should be a complete copy ready for fast download soon after 0100 GMT.  If you have a fast down pipe I suggest waiting until then before starting d/l because my upload to the seedbox is only 832 kbps.  I will check for corrupt parts when upload ought to be complete so don't fret if you get 99% again for a time, it will be fixed if necessary.\n\nHighlights will be up a few hours after this completes.\n\n\nThe Queen Stage of the Tour de France? Certainly this is the one with the greatest count of vertical metres. It starts with the tough Glandon and then the race half-pipes the Maurienne valley to scale the Madeleine which is several metres short of its 2,000m label. The TamiÃƒÂ© is not famous but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard and on a narrow road, the same for the Epine which is as thorny as its name suggests, a narrow road that is consistently steep. Then itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on to the Croix Fry with its switchbacks. Whoever crosses the final climb of the day could hope to win if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got 30 seconds because the descent to Grand Bornand is fast.\n\n(profile pic and description from inrng.com/tour/#Stage19)\n\n\nSD broadcast, encapsulated 16:9, 576i, 25fps at ~2500kbps transcoded by ffmpeg/x264 to 576p with settings -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset veryfast -vf &quot;yadif=0:-1:0&quot; -c:a libfdk_aac -ab 64000 -ac 2.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcb808f0e934ce135367288ee307400548a1fe4e","amp;dn":"Tour+de+France+2013+stage+19+-+Bourg++d%27Oisans+to+Le+Grand+Borna","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcb808f0e934ce135367288ee307400548a1fe4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,184,8,240,233,52,206,19,83,103,40,142,227,7,64,5,72,161,254,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
