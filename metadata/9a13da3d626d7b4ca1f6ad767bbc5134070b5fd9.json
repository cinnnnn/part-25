The challenges he faces are those of many fathers â€“ how to make ends meet, keep his wife and daughters happy and impress his daughterâ€™s future in-laws. Things would be so much easier if everyone just listened to him and followed his lead, but his obsessively house-proud wife and two feisty daughters usually have other ideas.\r\n\r\n Citizen Khan was created by Adil Ray. The character Mr Khan has already featured in BBC Two comedy series Bellamyâ€™s People and on Radio Fourâ€™s Down the Line. In addition Mr Khan also hosted his own web series for the BBC Comedy website, in which he covered a variety of topics including the General Election, cricket and even delivered his own Christmas message to the nation.\r\n \r\n \r\n \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03c8nd8\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\r\n\r\n[b]\r\n\r\nCitizen Khan Series 01 (6x30 Minutes)\r\n \r\nCitizen Khan Series 02 (7x30 Minutes) Includes Christmas Special \r\n \r\nCitizen Khan Series 03 (7x30 Minutes) Includes Christmas Special \r\n\r\nCitizen Khan Series 04 (7x30 Minutes) Includes Christmas Special \r\n\r\n===================== General =====================\r\nComplete name : Citizen Khan.avi\r\nFormat : AVI\r\nFormat info : Audio Video Interleave\r\nFile size : 350 MB\r\nDuration (ms) : 28mn 30s\r\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String : Variable\r\nTotal bitrate : 1 716 Kbps\r\nEncoded application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\r\nEncoded library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\r\n\r\n===================== Video =====================\r\nId : 0\r\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\r\nFormat profile : Advanced   \r\nFormat settings - BVOP : 1\r\nFormat settings - QPel : No\r\nFormat settings - GMC : No warppoints\r\nFormat settings - Matrix : Custom\r\nCodec Id : XVID\r\nCodec : XviD\r\nDuration (ms) : 28mn 30s\r\nBitrate : 1 595 Kbps\r\nWidth : 720 pixels\r\nHeight : 416 pixels\r\nAspect ratio : 1.731\r\nFramerate : 25.000 fps\r\nColorimetry : YUV\r\nColos space : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\nScan type : Progressive\r\nCompression_Mode/String : Lossy\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.213\r\nStream size : 325 MB (93%)\r\nEncoded library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\r\n\r\n===================== Audio =====================\r\nId : 1\r\nFormat : MPEG Audio\r\nFormat version : Version 1\r\nFormat profile : Layer 3\r\nFormat settings mode : Joint stereo\r\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\r\nCodec Id : 55\r\nCodec : MP3\r\nDuration (ms) : 28mn 30s\r\nBitrate mode : Variable\r\nBitrate : 108 Kbps\r\nBitRate_Nominal/String : 128 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression_Mode/String : Lossy\r\nStream size : 22.1 MB (6%)\r\nAlignement : Aligned on interleaves\r\nInterleave duration : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\r\nInterleave preload : 619 ms\r\nEncoded library : LAME3.98r\r\nEncoded library settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a13da3d626d7b4ca1f6ad767bbc5134070b5fd9","amp;dn":"Citizen+Khan+-+S01+to+S04+-+And+3+Christmas+Specials+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a13da3d626d7b4ca1f6ad767bbc5134070b5fd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,19,218,61,98,109,123,76,161,246,173,118,123,188,81,52,7,11,95,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
