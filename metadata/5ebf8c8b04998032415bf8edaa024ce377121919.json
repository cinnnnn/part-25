As a tabloid reporter at \n\n&quot;Pulse! Gossip&quot; in Los Angeles, it's her job to expose the rich and famous for the \n\nentertainment of the magazine's readers. So when word gets out that one of the late \n\nSenator Tannehill's two sons might be proposing marriage at the family's Big Bear compound \n\nduring Christmas, Greta and her chief rival Wes (Tom Lenk) are challenged by their old-\n\nschool editor to get the scoop. There's incentive to be the first, too-- the editorship of \n\nthe magazine's new online incarnation.\n\nGreta's assistant tells her that Wes has a head start to snowy Big Bear, so she dashes to \n\nthe mountain resort. When she mistakenly ends up as a guest of the family, she's in the \n\nmiddle of what could be her best story yet! However, she soon discovers that the family, \n\nincluding matriarch Maggie Tannenhill (Patricia Richardson) and caretaker Peters (Robert \n\nCurtis Brown), are more down-to-earth than she ever gave them credit for. Increasingly \n\nguilt-ridden about her game of subterfuge, Greta must make a decision: how far will she go \n\nfor the sake of a story?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nCast\nCredited cast:\n\tJake Ryan Scott \t... \t\nSupporting\nRest of cast listed alphabetically:\n\tSusie Abromeit \t... \t\nClaire\n\tKeith Andreen \t... \t\nDoria's Husband\n\tDana Barron \t... \t\nDoria\n\tJordan Belfi \t\t\nAlexandra Brewer \tAlexandra Brewer \t... \t\nBridesmaid\n\tMichael Chandler \t... \t\nFootball Announcer\n\tRobert Curtis Brown \t... \t\nPeters\n\tTania Gunadi \t... \t\nJulie\n\tKatrina Law \t\t\n\tBilly Marquart \t... \t\nCousin Eddie\n\tScott Thomas Reynolds \t... \t\nCharlie (Barista)\n\tPatricia Richardson \t\t\n\tStewart Scott \t... \t\nMayor \t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ebf8c8b04998032415bf8edaa024ce377121919","amp;dn":"Snow+Bride_720p.HDTV.x264_TTL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ebf8c8b04998032415bf8edaa024ce377121919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,191,140,139,4,153,128,50,65,91,248,237,170,2,76,227,119,18,25,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
