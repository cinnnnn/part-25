The power behind Ã¢â‚¬ËœI Cannot Say I Will Not SpeakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ holds a similar feel to Ã¢â‚¬ËœI Speak Because I CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, though WardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice is more comparable to Amy MacDonald than Laura Marling. Regardless, the opening track is the work of a woman of great strength, determination and intense talent.\n\nThe album, though progressive is still laced with traditional folk sounds. Ã¢â‚¬ËœHoneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is charmingly soft, WardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Derby accent giving the song a wonderfully English, familiar feel, complementing the gentle guitar plucking. A highlight of the album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Last PirouetteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ feels all the more traditional in both beat and lyric, with an acappella opening WardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice compels the listener, really emphasising her storytelling ability, set to flowing strings and twinkling percussion.\n\nAs Ward ups the tempo, her sound takes on a jaunty feel similar to that of Keston CobblerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Club particularly in Ã¢â‚¬ËœMarching Through the Green GrassÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, illustrating the soldierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s march about which she sings with intense and uneasy feeling.\n\nWith Single Flame Lucy ward has created an album that illustrates all facets of both her personality and talent. With Ã¢â‚¬ËœHoneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœInkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ she shows a tenderness of soul and a light musical touch, while in Ã¢â‚¬ËœI Cannot Say I Will Not SpeakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœMarching Through the Green GrassÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ she shows musical mastery and feistiness and strength of character. In Lucy Ward we have a talented writer, storyteller and musician with much to offer and a lovely Derby accent to top it all off!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69761372f16febdb77e9822179bd719ef7461f83","amp;dn":"Lucy+Ward+-+Single+Flame+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69761372f16febdb77e9822179bd719ef7461f83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,118,19,114,241,111,235,219,119,233,130,33,121,189,113,158,247,70,31,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
