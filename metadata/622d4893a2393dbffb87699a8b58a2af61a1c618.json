The blockbuster success of the Spice Girls and Backstreet Boys certainly paved the way for her own commercial breakthrough, but Spears didn't just become a star - she was a bona fide pop phenomenon. Not only did she sell millions of records, she was a media fixture regardless of what she was (or wasn't) doing; among female singers of the era (many of whom followed in her footsteps), her celebrity star power was rivaled only by Jennifer Lopez.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Me Against The Music\n02.(I Got That) Boom Boom\n03.Showdown\n04.Breathe On Me\n05.Early Mornin'\n06.Toxic\n07.Outrageous\n08.Touch Of My Hand\n09.The Hoop Up\n10.Shadow\n11.Brave New Girl\n12.Everytime\n13.Baby One More Time\n14.Walk On By\n15.Where Are You Now\n16.Lucky\n17.Oops!
