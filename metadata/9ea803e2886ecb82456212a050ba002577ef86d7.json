Do your teaching materials treat them that way? FeldmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Essentials of Understanding Psychology does. \n\nUsing a revolutionary revision process, Bob FeldmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Essentials of Understanding Psychology is a fully integrated learning system that gives students an even greater opportunity to achieve success, and brings the Students First goal to a new level. With an adaptive learning system that provides an individualized learning environment and helps students identify what they know, and more importantly, what they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, every student has a unique experience refined to their needs.\n\nThe thoroughly revised Tenth Edition is a first of its kind, revised using Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeatMapÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ technology in which systematic and precise feedback from thousands of students was anonymously measured using LearnSmart, the adaptive learning diagnostic. Because virtually every paragraph in the previous edition is tied to several questions students answer in LearnSmart, Bob was able to see where students struggled mostÃ¢â‚¬Â¦the Ã¢â‚¬Å“hot spotsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¦and in turn refine and update these areas to be more clear, more concise, and more impactful. \n\nThe 10th edition continues Bob FeldmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accessible pedagogy and hallmark research, as well as his modules-within-chapters format that is both manageable for students and allows every professor the flexibility to assign and cover what they want. The 4 additional modules in CREATE give instructors even extra flexibility to completely cater their text to their course and their students.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo Password or Surveys.
