Real estate developer Dharmen Shah rose from nothing to create an empire and hopes to seal his legacy with a luxury building named the Shanghai. Larger-than-life Shah is a dangerous man to refuse. But he meets his match in retired schoolteacher Masterji. Shah offers a generous buyout to Masterji and his neighbors in a once respectable, now crumbling apartment building on whose site ShahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high-rise would be built. They canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe their good fortune. Except, that is, for Masterji, who refuses to abandon the building he has long called home. As the demolition deadline looms, desires mount; neighbors become enemies, and acquaintances turn into conspirators who risk losing their humanity to score their payday. Here is a richly told, suspense-fueled story of ordinary people pushed to their limits in a place that knows none: the new India as only Aravind Adiga could exploreÃ¢â‚¬â€and exposeÃ¢â‚¬â€it.\n\n\n\nA Best Book of the Year: \nThe Boston Globe\nRichmond Times-Dispatch\nThe Daily Beast\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Brilliant. . . . If you loved the movie Slumdog Millionaire, you will inhale the novel Last Man in Tower. AdigaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second novel is even better than the superb White Tiger. . . . First-rate. . . . You simply do not realize how anemic most contemporary fiction is until you read AdigaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s muscular prose. His plots donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t unwind, they surge.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nÃ¢â‚¬â€USA Today\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Provocative and decadent. . . . The kind of novel thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so richly insightful . . . itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to know where to begin singing its praises. . . . Vain, shrewd and stubborn, [Masterji] is one of the most delightfully contradictory characters to appear in recent fiction.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Washington Post\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Masterful. . . . With this gripping, amusing glimpse into the contradictions and perils of modern India, Adiga cements his reputation as the preeminent chronicler of his countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s messy present.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nÃ¢â‚¬â€Newsweek\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Adiga has written the story of a New India. . . . This funny and poignant story is multidimensional, layered with many engaging stories and characters.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Seattle Times\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A rare achievement. . . . Adiga captures with heartbreaking authenticity the real struggle in Indian cities, which is for dignity. A funny yet deeply melancholic work, Last Man in Tower is a brilliant, and remarkably mature, second novel.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Economist\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“With wit and observation, Adiga gives readers a well-rounded portrait of Mumbai in all of its teeming, bleating, inefficient glory. . . . Like any good novelist, AdigaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story lingers because it nestles in the heart and the head.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nÃ¢â‚¬â€Christian Science Monitor \n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Last Man in Tower is a nuanced study of human nature in all of its complexity and mystery. (It is also humane and funny.) Nothing is quite as it seems in the novel, which makes for surprises both pleasant and disturbing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nÃ¢â‚¬â€Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Adiga populates his fiction with characters from all parts of IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contemporary social spectrum, and the intensity of his anger at aspects of modern India is modulated by his impish wit.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Wall Street Journal \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94afcf02941718d8177e35cb4735fdfd7404f068","amp;dn":"Aravind+Adiga+-+Last+Man+in+Tower","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94afcf02941718d8177e35cb4735fdfd7404f068","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,175,207,2,148,23,24,216,23,126,53,203,71,53,253,253,116,4,240,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
