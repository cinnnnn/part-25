Set up virtual printers to save files anywhere, or send files directly to a Mac app. \n\n\t\nSerious Security For Privacy and Peace of Mind\nWith the addition of password protection for your printers, Printopia is a great solution for a shared environment such as an office of classroom. Industry standard encryption protects your print jobs between your iOS device and your Mac.\n\n\t\nSave Paper With A Printopia Virtual Printer\nAdd unlimited &quot;Send To Mac&quot; virtual printers to your network. This lets you &quot;print&quot; a file directly to your Mac or even send files directly to a Mac app such as iPhoto and Evernote. No need to waste paper next time you need to print a confirmation page. Keep your files organized by configuring multiple virtual printers with different save destinations.\n\n\t\nPrint To Your Mac's Dropbox Folder\nusers can print PDF and JPG files directly to the Mac's Dropbox folder.
