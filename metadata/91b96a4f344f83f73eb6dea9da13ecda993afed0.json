When we last heard from her she vowed to Shake This Town. This time around Denham has her sights firmly set on shaking the very foundations of regional and cities throughout Australia, with her self-proclaimed style of Renegade Country. It's one part rockÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ one part countryÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and it's all proudly and loudly Australian!\n\nJayne Denham worked closely in the studio with award-winning producer Garth Porter (Lee Kernaghan, Sara Storer, James Blundell) to capture the excitement and electricity of her live show.\n\nPulsing tracks like Ã¢â‚¬ËœRenegadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœAddicted To The DieselÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœJam The JamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are signs of new times and each are destined for the big stage, with strong hooks and a razor-sharp rock edge. Fans of Jayne DenhamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous releases will instantly relate to country party tracks, Ã¢â‚¬ËœCowgirls MIAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœTrick It Up.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ While Ã¢â‚¬ËœShelterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœGrew Up Round TrucksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ both melt hearts and show a new element of JayneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical evolution to music fans. Ã¢â‚¬ËœThis Is RodeoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a new anthem and Ã¢â‚¬ËœOutlawÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is classic Aussie lore, focusing on two of the country's most famous female bushrangers.\n\nPerhaps one of the most exciting tracks is Ã¢â‚¬ËœBeyond These City LightsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which pairs Jayne's vocals with those of special guest Shannon Noll. Noll penned the track with acclaimed songwriter Lindsay Rimes and felt it was a perfect fit for Renegade.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91b96a4f344f83f73eb6dea9da13ecda993afed0","amp;dn":"Jayne+Denham+-+Renegade+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91b96a4f344f83f73eb6dea9da13ecda993afed0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,185,106,79,52,79,131,247,62,182,222,169,218,19,236,218,153,58,254,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
