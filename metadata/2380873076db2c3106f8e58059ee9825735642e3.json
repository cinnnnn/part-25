It's time for you to start reaping the benefits of my indie connections! Just got the PING 1.5+ Beta from the developer not too long ago :) This is a PC download just in case you were wondering. Enjoy!\n \nThe download for the beta will prompt you for a password, that password is &quot;pingplus15&quot; without the quotations. \n \nHave fun! Remind me to keep you guys updated on the Beta updates.\n \nWhy not post your screenshots here too? I'd love to see them. (Just press Fn+Prtscrn on keyboard to take screenshot)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thewiiu.com/topic/17837-ping-15-pc-beta/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thewiiu.com/topic/17837-ping-15-pc-beta/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2380873076db2c3106f8e58059ee9825735642e3","amp;dn":"PING+1.5%2B+Beta+v0.05","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2380873076db2c3106f8e58059ee9825735642e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,128,135,48,118,219,44,49,6,248,229,128,89,238,152,37,115,86,66,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
