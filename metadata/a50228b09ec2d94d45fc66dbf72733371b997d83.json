Dopplereffekt were one of the strangest and most mysterious units of the contemporary electronic music scene. Arpanet uses a typical &quot;Detroit electro&quot; formula with creepy outdated science-fiction sounds and great 808-fueled dance beats. The project's name &quot;Arpanet&quot; is borrowed from the ARPANET network, the network from which today's Internet evolved.\n\nIf you're one of those people who could never tire of Dopplereffekt, then Arpanet demands at least one listen. If you're looking for &quot;Electroclash&quot;, then you've got the wrong address; you might want to wait for the next Fischerspooner remix of Miss Kittin covering Duran Duran or something.\n\nTracklisting\n\n1 The Analyst (4:02)\n2 Illuminated Displays (6:05)\n3 I-Mode (2:30)\n4 Wireframe Images (5:37)\n5 P2101V (4:01)\n6 NTT DoCoMo (4:38)\n7 Software Version (5:09)\n8 Devoid Of Wires (4:36)\n9 Wireless Internet (5:54)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a50228b09ec2d94d45fc66dbf72733371b997d83","amp;dn":"Arpanet+-+Wireless+Internet+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a50228b09ec2d94d45fc66dbf72733371b997d83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,2,40,176,158,194,217,77,69,252,102,219,247,39,51,55,27,153,125,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
