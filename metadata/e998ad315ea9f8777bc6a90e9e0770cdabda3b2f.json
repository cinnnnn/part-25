The similarities donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t end there, either: Mariah revives her original seasonal tune ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAll I Want for Christmas Is YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and often touches upon the classy, clean updated traditional vibe of her readings from the 1994 set. Underneath this surface, Merry Christmas II You has a different vibe than its predecessor, derived in large part from the numerous originals here. Five of the 12 full songs bear a Carey writing credit (including that revival of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAll I Want for Christmas Is YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and these new tunes sometimes give Merry Christmas II You a lively modern feel, particularly the jumping Jermaine Dupri/Bryan-Michael Cox co-written opener ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOh Santa!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the slow groove of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhen Christmas Comes,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ highlights that balance the too saccharine sentiment of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChristmas Time Is in the Air AgainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOne Child.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The range of these originals indicates the scope of the record as a whole, how it touches on a little of everything to please every kind of audience, mixing up ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAuld Lang SyneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and a medley of Vince GuaraldiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Charlie Brown Christmas with traditional religious carols and secular favorites like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHere Comes Santa Claus.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Apart from that pair of stiff originals, the whole thing is cheerful and engaging, a worthy sequel to its predecessor. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e998ad315ea9f8777bc6a90e9e0770cdabda3b2f","amp;dn":"Mariah+Carey+-+Merry+Christmas+II+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e998ad315ea9f8777bc6a90e9e0770cdabda3b2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,152,173,49,94,169,248,119,123,198,169,14,158,7,112,205,171,218,59,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
