The producer stated that the final result was achieved after countless hours of intense work and energy consumption. \n\n Every piece is a self-inclusive story with strong editing complexity, brilliant vocal lines and a picturesque melody, uniquely made for enticing you to stand up and move. \n\n Expect AWESOME uplifting vibes, produced with enormous passion, proficiency and compiled for ambitious non-commercial tastes. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca89b65540e72bf551acda16da050bdf38c4a2d4","amp;dn":"Open+Source+-+Enormously+Insignificant+%282014%29+Abum+%40+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca89b65540e72bf551acda16da050bdf38c4a2d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,137,182,85,64,231,43,245,81,172,218,22,218,5,11,223,56,196,162,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
