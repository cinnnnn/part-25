The content of the entries has been kept brief and concise to provide a definition or fundamental facts.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom School Library Journal\nGrade 8 UpÃ¢â‚¬â€œThis solid, accessible book is global in range, spanning prehistory to the present day. Its clear, pithy text provides good introductions and/or fine refreshers on diverse topics that might be of use to students rather than encyclopedic coverage. Inclusion criteria were based on various history education standards and Advanced Placement test guidelines. The volume starts with an alphabetical list of entries (with some cross-references), followed by a topical list with alternate spellings in parentheses. The 2188 entries are divided into roughly continental regions, with an other section providing information on issues that are international in scope. Sixty-five black-and-white maps cover topics such as Beginnings of Civilization, Silk Roads, Slave Trade, and World War I Alliances. Essentials such as Plato and the American Civil War are covered, but less-well-known topics can be hit or miss: the obscure Council of Pisa is included but the more widely known Nicean Council of 425 is not. Though the 22-page index is generally excellent, there are some small cross-referencing inconsistencies, e.g., Eightfold Path refers readers to Nirvana, but the reverse is not true. The titles in the brief list for further reading date from 1989 to 2006. Though more concise, this book is similar in scope to the one-volume Oxford Encyclopedia of World History (1999).Ã¢â‚¬â€œJohn Palmer, Bryan &amp; College Station Library System, Bryan, TX\nCopyright Ã‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nFrom Booklist\nDesigned for high-school and college students, this resource emerged from state standards and other guidelines and recommendations on the teaching of history. The author, a U.S. history professor, has brought &quot;over 2,000 of the most studied and important people, events, places, and ideas&quot; in entries usually a brief paragraph long but sometimes a page ( Civil rights movement) or just a few sentences.\nAlphabetically arranged in double columns, the entries range from prehistory to the present. Among the topics one will find here are Chinese philosopher Han Feizi (c. 280-233 BCE); Hijra, the escape of Muhammad from Mecca in 622, which marks the start of the Muslim calendar; Lucy, whose bones discovered in South Africa in 1924 pinpoint the Australopithecine step in human evolution; Gloria Steinem, founder of Ms. magazine in 1972; and WAVES, the women's branch of the U.S. Navy from 1942 to 1972. Running heads, cross-references in boldface type, and an alphabetical list of entries enable users to quickly locate information, as does the &quot;Topical List of Entries,&quot; which arranges content by region and era. Entries are preceded by some 70 black-and-white maps. The information is accurate and current. A list of history Web sites is helpful, and the bibliography at the end of the volume includes very recent publications. The accurate index furthers the overall helpfulness of the work.\nWhile a one-volume dictionary of world history cannot be comprehensive, the author has clearly carried out the intent of the work. The new edition of Chambers Dictionary of World History (Chambers, 2005) provides more comprehensive coverage of key figures and events in more than 7,500 entries. Although the information in Greenwood can be located elsewhere, its strengths in topics beyond U.S. history and the fact that it was developed based on widely accepted guidelines make it especially valuable for students, teachers, and librarians as an initial reference source.

All rights reserved\n\nReviews\n&quot;More than 2000 cross-referenced A-to-Z entries offer brief definitions or explanations of world religions, scientific events, wars, military leaders, inventions, discoveries, and more from prehistoric to modern times and are indexed by region, period, and theme; the bibliography with each entry relates to the entry's subject. Entries range from Aachen, Charlemagne's capital, to noted Swiss reformer Zwingli. There is an emphasis on Middle Eastern, Asian, African, and Latin American history. In comparison to the Oxford Dictionary of World History, this eclectic title contains a clearer, easier-to-read format, larger maps (70 in all), web sites, and other updated featuresÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.[d]esigned to be consulted for small bits of information or in answering quick questions-this could be considered a useful complement to more comprehensive works and would serve well as a cost-effective starting place for young searchers, encouraging continued exploration on their topics.
