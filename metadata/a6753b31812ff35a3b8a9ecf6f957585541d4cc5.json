That is to say, she catches crooks and turns them in to the police for pay. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a far cry from caped derring-do, but then HovertonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a far cry from Metropolis.\n\n ChelaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most reliable partner is her talking weapon, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gunn,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to which she is cybernetically linked. Her human partnersÃ¢â‚¬â€even the toughest onesÃ¢â‚¬â€tend not to live very long. So when she is assigned an overprivileged, slightly effeminate lightweight named Leslie Steele, all she can think of is getting him on the first shuttle out of town before he gets killed. As it turns out, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exactly what the higher-ups had planned for him before he could piece together a puzzling set of murders in which they had a hand.\n\n Cyberzone is a well-written (and often surprisingly funny) action series, created as a solo effort by Jimmie Robinson. \n\n Enjoy and Seed ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6753b31812ff35a3b8a9ecf6f957585541d4cc5","amp;dn":"Cyberzone+%281994%29+Complete+Jimmie+Robinson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6753b31812ff35a3b8a9ecf6f957585541d4cc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,117,59,49,129,47,243,90,59,138,158,207,111,149,117,133,84,29,76,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
