Now a grown man with a military career behind him, Rock continues to deny his true desires, even while working security at The Den, the most decadent sex club in town. But after a year of watching gorgeous Carter Montgomery come and go on the arms of other men, Rock can no longer resist the cravings he's denied for so long.\n\nCarter has just four months left on his contract with an escort agency, and he doesn't know whether to feel relieved or afraid. Being an escort is all he knows. Adding to his confusion is the way his latest client, the sexy but stoic Rock, makes him feel things he hasn't wanted in years.\n\nOne charmingly awkward date turns into two and soon the men are meeting off the clock. But with Rock in the closet and Carter unsure how to pursue a real relationship, how can they build a future both in and out of the bedroom?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a797406f7c0223e8ea1cfbb068eb6a77bcf49ae2","amp;dn":"Lynda+Aicher+-+Bonds+of+Denial+-+Wicked+Play+05","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a797406f7c0223e8ea1cfbb068eb6a77bcf49ae2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,151,64,111,124,2,35,232,234,28,251,176,104,235,106,119,188,244,154,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
