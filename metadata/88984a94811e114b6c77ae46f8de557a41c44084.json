Coaxed by the reverend, a frustrated \nFlanders takes it upon himself to redeem Homer by inviting the \nSimpson family on his church retreat to Jerusalem. \nUnappreciative of the history and culture, Homer would rather \nhang out at the hotel's breakfast buffet rather than tour the \ncity. But when an eccentric tour guide (guest voice Cohen) \ntakes the group to famous monuments, including the Dome of the \nRock and the Wailing Wall, Homer finally proves he is not \nbeyond salvation.\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88984a94811e114b6c77ae46f8de557a41c44084","amp;dn":"The.Simpsons.S21E16.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88984a94811e114b6c77ae46f8de557a41c44084","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,152,74,148,129,30,17,75,108,119,174,70,248,222,85,122,65,196,64,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
