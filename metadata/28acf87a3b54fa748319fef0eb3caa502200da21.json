With a new foreword for this paperback edition.\nIn this major bestseller, Paul Krugman warns that, like diseases that have become resistant to antibiotics, the economic maladies that caused the Great Depression have made a comeback. He lays bare the 2008 financial crisisÃ¢â‚¬â€the greatest since the 1930sÃ¢â‚¬â€tracing it to the failure of regulation to keep pace with an out-of-control financial system. He also tells us how to contain the crisis and turn around a world economy sliding into a deep recession. Brilliantly crafted in KrugmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark styleÃ¢â‚¬â€lucid, lively, and supremely informedÃ¢â‚¬â€this new edition of The Return of Depression Economics has become an instant classic. A hard-hitting new foreword takes the paperback edition right up to the present moment.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Return-Depression-Economics-Crisis-2008/dp/0393337804/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352063369&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=depression+economics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Return-Depression-Economics-Crisis-2008/dp/0393337804/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352063369&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=depression+economics&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28acf87a3b54fa748319fef0eb3caa502200da21","amp;dn":"The+Return+of+Depression+Economics+and+the+Crisis+of+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28acf87a3b54fa748319fef0eb3caa502200da21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,172,248,122,59,84,250,116,131,25,254,240,235,60,170,80,34,0,218,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
