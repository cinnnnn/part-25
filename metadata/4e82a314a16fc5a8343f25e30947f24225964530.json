It might be on the sweet side, but sometimes that's just exactly what is needed. Anyway, there is Christopher Plummer as the captain to balance out all that sweetness. I always thought he had a great voice and terrific screen presence in this film.\n\nJulie Andrews at her freshest and best...her singing is wonderful, the alps are wonderful, the songs are memorable, and the story line never gets boring.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e82a314a16fc5a8343f25e30947f24225964530","amp;dn":"1966-The+Sound+of+Music-Julie+Andrews-drama%2Cfamilie%2Cmuzical","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e82a314a16fc5a8343f25e30947f24225964530","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,130,163,20,161,111,197,168,52,63,37,227,9,71,242,66,37,150,69,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
