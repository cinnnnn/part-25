Soul Serenade may also be considered Trucks' third album, as it was entirely recorded before Joyful Noise, but was held up in legalities, and therefore released later.\n\nSoul Serenade continues this band's exploration of genre ambiguity. Refusing to be tied to a single genre (Blues, specifically) alienated some fans, but has allowed Derek Trucks and his band to express themselves creatively in ways that would not be possible if confined to a single genre.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTrack listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. &quot;Soul Serenade / Rasta Man Chant&quot; (C.
