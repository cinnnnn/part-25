It is widely accepted that a diet too high in sugar can cause mood swings, fatigue, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and even premature ageing. But eating low-sugar foods doesn't have to mean being condemned to a dull diet, as the wonderful range of recipes in this book demonstrates. The good news is that there are numerous naturally sweet foods and flavourings that can be substituted so that there's no need to resort to artificial sweeteners with their reported adverse health effects. Here, Nicola Graimes presents more than 100 easy-to-follow meals and snacks, inspired by recipes from around the world. Chapters are divided into Breakfasts, Brunches, Light Meals, Snacks, Dinners, Desserts, and Cakes, Bakes, Breads. You'll find delicious family favourites ranging from curries, stews, stir-fries and salads to sponge puddings, muffins and cheesecakes. Savoury foods can also be surprisingly high in added sugar, particularly canned foods and sauces, and you'll find specially adapted dishes for healthier, low-sugar alternatives. All the recipes have been carefully created to be suitable for diabetics to meet their dietary requirements. This means that they are also low in salt and saturated fat and high in unrefined carbohydrates and fibre Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not forgetting packed with bountiful amounts of fresh produce. Clear at-a-glance symbols highlighting nutritional benefits provide an additional valuable feature.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41cbf434ae88571c26ee9b5291b0ea7436e86a8f","amp;dn":"The+Low-Sugar+Cookbook+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41cbf434ae88571c26ee9b5291b0ea7436e86a8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,203,244,52,174,136,87,28,38,238,155,82,145,176,234,116,54,232,106,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
