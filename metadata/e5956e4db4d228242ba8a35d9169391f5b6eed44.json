With this much time invested, author Donna Dunning asserts that your career should be interesting, motivating and rewarding. In her highly acclaimed first book, What's Your Type of Career?, Dunning delivered a set of powerful tools that for the first time linked personality type to career success and helped thousands of individuals chart a path to professional growth and greater job satisfaction. In this follow-up book, 10 Career Essentials tells readers how to further use their personality type to tailor their career success strategies to their personal preferences. Each chapter describes one career success strategy - such as optimizing your outlook, exceeding expectations and thriving amidst uncertainty - providing self-assessment tools and tips to stimulate learning and improve your ability to implement a personal career strategy to its fullest.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5956e4db4d228242ba8a35d9169391f5b6eed44","amp;dn":"Road+Map+To+Huge+Arms+%2B+No+Nonsense+Muscle+Building+%2B+10+Career+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5956e4db4d228242ba8a35d9169391f5b6eed44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,149,110,77,180,210,40,36,43,168,163,93,145,105,57,31,91,110,237,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
