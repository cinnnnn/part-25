However, only Andy knows that he didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t commit the crimes. Sent to Shawshank Prison to do hard time, AndyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“a taciturn banker in the outside worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“has to learn to get by in the brutal, cutthroat confines of prison life. His quiet strength slowly earns the respect of his fellow inmatesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“most notably, Red (Morgan Freeman)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“and even much of the prison staff. But AndyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seemingly stoic acceptance of his unjust imprisonment hides a fierce determination for freedom.\n\n\n\n\nIMDB rating: 9.2/10 (481.108 votes)\nDirected by: Frank Darabont\nStarring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton\n\nRelease Name: The.Shawshank.Redemption.1994.DVDRip.XviD.iNT-MOViERUSH\nSize: 1.4GB\nRuntime: 142 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1951ede40ff8ddac2bd2bc3992b76f9b971f860b","amp;dn":"The.Shawshank.Redemption.1994.DVDRip.XviD.iNT-MOViERUSH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1951ede40ff8ddac2bd2bc3992b76f9b971f860b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,81,237,228,15,248,221,172,43,210,188,57,146,183,111,155,151,31,134,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
