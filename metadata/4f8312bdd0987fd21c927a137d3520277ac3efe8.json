It was directed by Lewis Milestone, and stars Louis Wolheim, Lew Ayres, John Wray, Arnold Lucy and Ben Alexander.\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front is considered a realistic and harrowing account of warfare in World War I, and was named #54 on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies. However, it fell out of the top 100 in the AFI's 2007 revision. In June 2008, after polling over 1,500 workers in the creative community, AFI announced its 10 Top 10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the ten best films in each of ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres; All Quiet on the Western Front was ranked the seventh best film in the epic genre. In 1990, the film was selected and preserved by the United States Library of Congress' National Film Registry as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nCast\n\nRichard Alexander as Westhus\nBen Alexander as Franz Kemmerich\nLew Ayres as Paul BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤umer\nWilliam Bakewell as Albert Kropp\nEdmund Breese as Herr Meyer\nG.

It contained anti-Nazi announcements read out throughout the film in a March of Time style; yet the aim was to remind people of the horrors of wars in a time of international unrest.\n\nLater re-releases by Universal International were substantially cut and the film's ending scored with new music against the wishes of director Lewis Milestone.[5] Before his death in 1980, Milestone requested Universal fully restore the film with the removal of the end music cue. Two decades later, Milestone's wishes were finally granted when the United States Library of Congress undertook an exhaustive restoration of the film, which is vastly superior in sound and picture quality to most other existent prints.\n\nThe film got tremendous praise in the United States, but there would be controversy over the film's subject matter in other places, including Europe.\n\nOn its release, Variety wrote:\nThe League of Nations could make no better investment than to buy up the master-print, reproduce it in every language, to be shown in all the nations until the word &quot;war&quot; is taken out of the dictionaries.\n\nSome of the credit for the film's success has been ascribed to the direction of Lewis Milestone:\nWithout diluting or denying any... criticisms, it should be said that from World War I to Korea, Milestone could put the viewer into the middle of a battlefield, and make the hellish confusion of it seem all too real to the viewer. Steven Spielberg noted as much when he credited Milestone's work as partial inspiration for Saving Private Ryan ...Lewis Milestone made significant contributions to [the genre of] the war film.\n\nDue to its anti-war and perceived anti-German messages, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party banned the film from Germany in the 1930s and early 1940s. During its brief run in German cinemas in the early 1930s, the Nazis disrupted the viewings by releasing rats in the theaters.\n\nAlso, between the period of 1928 to 1941, this was one of many films to be banned in Australia by the Chief Censor Creswell O'Reilly. The film was also banned in Italy in 1929, Austria in 1931, with the prohibition officially raised only in the 1980s, and in France up to 1963.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f8312bdd0987fd21c927a137d3520277ac3efe8","amp;dn":"Best+Picture+-+1930+-+All+Quiet+on+the+Western+Front","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f8312bdd0987fd21c927a137d3520277ac3efe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,131,18,189,208,152,127,210,28,146,122,19,125,53,32,39,122,195,239,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
