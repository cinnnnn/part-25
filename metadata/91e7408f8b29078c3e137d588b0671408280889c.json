The fifth edition uses all strands of the &quot;Rule of Four&quot; - graphical, numeric, symbolic/algebraic, and verbal/applied presentations - to make concepts easier to understand. The book focuses on exploring fundamental ideas rather than comprehensive coverage of multiple similar cases that are not fundamentally unique.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91e7408f8b29078c3e137d588b0671408280889c","amp;dn":"Calculus+%28Single+Variable%29+Fifth+Edition+-+Hughes-Hallet+Gleason","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91e7408f8b29078c3e137d588b0671408280889c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,231,64,143,139,41,7,140,62,19,125,88,139,6,113,64,130,128,136,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
