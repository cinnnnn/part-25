Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ceccae5e18fafba01d7cf0622b65786883d8c55","amp;dn":"Rudimentary+Peni+-+Death+Church+-+1983+%28320kbps+CBR+-+INCREASED+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ceccae5e18fafba01d7cf0622b65786883d8c55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,236,202,229,225,143,175,186,1,215,207,6,34,182,87,134,136,61,140,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
