As you might imagine, this is a core skill to master if you want to become productive with your PC. While some of the material we show in this video will be familiar to those of you who have used previous versions of Windows, Windows 7 brings some handy new tricks of its own which will help you to be more productive when using your PC. Three of these new features are Aero Peek, Aero Snap and Aero Shake. The video will demonstrate how these new features make it easer than ever before to work with multiple windows.\n\n\n\nAdditional notes\n================\n\nIf you use Aero Shake to minimise windows, you can restore them again in the same way. Simply shake the window again and the other windows will be restored.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fa877411a75834f3ba534744e7d3dd0e4b2184f","amp;dn":"Windows+7+Tutorial+3+%26ndash%3B+Windows+in+Windows+7+%28Basics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fa877411a75834f3ba534744e7d3dd0e4b2184f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,168,119,65,26,117,131,79,59,165,52,116,78,125,61,208,228,178,24,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
