Forces of inconceivable magnitude moved through the mass. The outer surface of the globe as it cooled ripped and shrivelled like a withering orange. Great ridges, the mountain chains of to-day, were furrowed on its skin. Here in the darkness of the prehistoric night there arose as the oldest part of the surface of the earth the great rock bed that lies in a huge crescent round the shores of Hudson Bay, from Labrador to the unknown wilderness of the barren lands of the Coppermine basin touching the Arctic sea. The wanderer who stands to-day in the desolate country of James Bay or Ungava is among the oldest monuments of the world. The rugged rock which here and there breaks through the thin soil of the infertile north has lain on the spot from the very dawn of time.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e426c2a5be2a14fdec096cf09dd0f736c8f547e","amp;dn":"The+Dawn+of+Canadian+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e426c2a5be2a14fdec096cf09dd0f736c8f547e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,66,108,42,91,226,161,79,222,192,150,207,9,221,15,115,108,143,84,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
