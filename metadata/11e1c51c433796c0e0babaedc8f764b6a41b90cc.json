No principles! Nothing sacred! 666% of pure positive energy and unbelievable dance metal mayhem. We are proud to present the result of inhuman experiments on interbreeding dance music vibes from the 90s of the past century and groovy metal sounds of the new millennium ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a 10-track debut album Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«Dance Metal [Rave]olutionÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» by Xe-NONE.  \n\n\n\nSounds\n\nXe-NONE have never made any secret of their diverse musical roots. Actively experimenting with various sounds and arrangements, the band has created a unique sound picture paying tribute to such groups as Fear Factory and Scooter, Cradle Of Filth and 2 Unlimited, as well as to many others. Hard to imagine? Just listen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ this is real!  \n\n\n\nTXT\n\nThe lyrical part of the album has been carefully thought out as well. Enthusiasm for life, self-reliance and a positive Weltanschauung - these are the main ideas underlying the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lyrical concept. You should always remain human regardless of the situation you are in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ be it either a global social crisis (Decay Dance), or a day job buring you alive (Day of the Dead). The two most emotional tracks are dedicated to such ever actual problems as suicide (Collapse) and mind control in religious sects (Heaven Awaits). Interpersonal issues of trust and unfaithfulness are also addressed in the album (Amnestesia). \n\n\n\nSite:\nhttp://xe-none.com\nYou can download this album from official site - http://xe-none.com/DMR_hi.rar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11e1c51c433796c0e0babaedc8f764b6a41b90cc","amp;dn":"Xe-NONE+-+Dance+Metal+%5BRave%5Dolution++%5BMP3%40320Kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11e1c51c433796c0e0babaedc8f764b6a41b90cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,225,197,28,67,55,150,192,224,186,186,237,200,247,100,182,164,27,144,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
