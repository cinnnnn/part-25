Much like the 8tracks Uploader for Macs, Music Manager lets users easily and quickly transfer songs to their Google Music Library in no time at all.\n\nYou can tweak the settings on Music Manager to automatically upload new music it detects from iTunes, Windows Media Player, or other storage media.\n\nIn addition to uploading songs, the program also provides a list of songs it was unable to upload, as well as a reason as to why the upload didn't work. Unfortunately, if you do encounter an error in uploading, Music Manager doesn't actually suggest a solution. You might just be out of luck, which could be frustrating.\n\nIf you want an easy-to-use method of uploading songs to your Google Music library, Music Manager is the way to go.\n\n\n\nTO INSTALL:\n\nOnce torrent has fully downloaded, click and run (as administrator if your system requires) \n\nFollow instructions\n\nLogin with the Gmail account containing all of your Google Play Music\n\nSeed and ENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcb6649283f5b11a882f007e432151f5394c387f","amp;dn":"Google+Music+Manager+-+vs+1.0.55.7425+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcb6649283f5b11a882f007e432151f5394c387f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,182,100,146,131,245,177,26,136,47,0,126,67,33,81,245,57,76,56,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
