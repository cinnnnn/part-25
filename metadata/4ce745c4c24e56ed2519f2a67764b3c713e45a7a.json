It is basically a program that makes\nrunning games on various emulators very easy, so that you don't have to remember lots of command line parameters and\nconfig settings. GameBase is also the Official Frontend for the GB64 Collection of Commodore 64 games!\nOnce you've downloaded the GB64 database and screenshots, you can use GameBase to view all the games, listen to sid\nmusic and even launch games themselves in various C64 emulators.\n\nEach game in a GameBase database can store more than just a game or rom file. It can also store a music file, game docs,\nscreenshots, and really any other files you wish (these are referred to in GameBase as Extras). For example, in the GB64\ndatabase, each game-entry in the database stores not just the game file, but also a sid-music file. You can add such extras\nas game docs, a magazine review, a cover scan, an mp3 remix, a link to a web site... the list goes on.\nAll these Extras are conveniently accessible in GameBase via a simple drop-down menu directly under a game's screenshot.\n\nThis torrent contains:\nDatabase Installer: (repacked to fit the rules) gb64v10.7z (this can be downloaded from website too)\nScreenshots package: gb64v10s.7z (this can be downloaded from website too)\nGames package: gb64v10g.7z\nOriginal games package: gb64v10o.7z\nMissing games package: gb64v10m.7z\nCover package: gb64v10c.7z\nDocs &amp; tips package: gb64v10d.7z\nAdverts: gb64v10a.7z (this is the same as in GB64v09)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ce745c4c24e56ed2519f2a67764b3c713e45a7a","amp;dn":"Gamebase64+v10+%5BMed64%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ce745c4c24e56ed2519f2a67764b3c713e45a7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,231,69,196,194,78,86,237,37,25,242,166,119,100,179,199,19,228,90,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
