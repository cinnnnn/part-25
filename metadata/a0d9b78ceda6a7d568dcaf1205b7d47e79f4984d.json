Most Loonies, as the Lunar colonists are known, are people or the descendants of people involuntarily transported to the Moon either for criminal or political reasons. Due to the low surface gravity of the Moon, anyone (including transportees from Earth) who stays longer than a few months undergoes &quot;irreversible physiological changes and can never again live in comfort and health in a gravitational field six times greater than that to which their bodies have become adjusted.&quot;\n\nAlthough the Earth-appointed Protector of the Lunar Colonies (universally called the Warden) is in charge, in practice, except for purchasing and selling commodities at fixed prices favorable to the government (the Lunar Authority), there is little intervention in Lunar society. Transportees, having served their sentences, join Lunar society. If they cannot get along in it, they are generally killed by other Loonies?there is work enough for anyone who wants it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0d9b78ceda6a7d568dcaf1205b7d47e79f4984d","amp;dn":"Robert+Heinlein+-+The+Moon+Is+a+Harsh+Mistress+%28abridged%29+-+Lloy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0d9b78ceda6a7d568dcaf1205b7d47e79f4984d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,217,183,140,237,166,167,213,104,220,175,18,5,183,212,126,121,244,152,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
