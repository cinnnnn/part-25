The idea of this tribute album was to re-create the album track-for-track using other artists. Since King had begun her career as a songwriter, with songs such as &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow?&quot; and &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; hitting for other artists before turning up on Tapestry, it was an appropriate concept. Though each artist was asked to submit a finished track, there was some musical continuity in that several tracks -- &quot;You&amp;#039;ve Got a Friend,&quot; by BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans, featuring Aretha Franklin, &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow?,&quot; by the Bee Gees, and &quot;Smackwater Jack,&quot; by the Manhattan Transfer -- were produced by Arif Mardin, and a couple of others -- &quot;So Far Away,&quot; by Rod Stewart, and &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,&quot; by Celine Dion -- were handled by David Foster. In such a project, casting is everything, and the best versions were turned in by artists who grew up with the original album, such as Amy Grant (&quot;It&amp;#039;s Too Late&quot;), Richard Marx (&quot;Beautiful&quot;), and Faith Hill (&quot;Where You Lead&quot;). Such artists achieved a reasonable compromise between the King versions and their own sound. Artists like the Bee Gees and Stewart, who were King&amp;#039;s contemporaries, seemed to be going through the motions, and a raft of newer artists, such as Eternal, Curtis Stigers, Blessid Union of Souls, All-4-One, and Dion, seemed to be on the album because someone at their management companies thought it would be a good idea and displayed little feel for the material. But King&amp;#039;s music has a flexibility that allows for many interpretations, and while this album could not be recommended over the original, the new performances didn&amp;#039;t do it much harm.\n================================================\nRipped From My CD (Butcherboys)\n================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5941d3731c66062e96fe85d8b04d365a8689708","amp;dn":"Tapestry+Revisited+-+A+Tribute+To+Carole+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5941d3731c66062e96fe85d8b04d365a8689708","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,148,29,55,49,198,96,98,233,111,232,93,139,4,211,101,168,104,151,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
