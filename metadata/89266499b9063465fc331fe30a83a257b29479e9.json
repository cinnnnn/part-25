(Over a decade prior to that, Pebe Sebert's biggest success had come with &quot;Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You,&quot; originally recorded by Joe Sun and later by Dolly Parton.) Before finishing high school, Kesha returned to L.A. for the sake of jump-starting her own music career, despite being set up to study psychology at Columbia. She came into contact with Dr. Luke, the co-writer and co-producer of Kelly Clarkson's &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; (among several other hits), who was impressed with her demo recordings. Kesha penned the Veronicas' &quot;This Love&quot; and later contributed background vocals to Britney Spears' &quot;Lace and Leather,&quot; both of which were released in 2008, but the biggest turning point came in 2009, when she was tapped to contribute vocals on Flo Rida's Dr. Luke-produced &quot;Right Round,&quot; a number one Hot 100 hit. She subsequently signed to RCA, and her debut album, Animal -- featuring collaborations with Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Benny Blanco -- was released in early 2010. Animal proved to be a big hit, reaching the top of the Billboard 200 and spinning off the number one single &quot;TiK ToK.&quot; The nine-song EP Cannibal appeared by the end of the year, featuring the single &quot;We R Who We R.&quot; It was followed by another stopgap release, 2011's I Am the Dance Commander + I Command You to Dance: The Remix Album. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info\n\n\n01.Cannibal\n02.We R Who We R\n03.Sleazy\n04.Blow\n05.The Harold Song\n06.Crazy Beautiful Life\n07.Grow A Pear\n08.C U Next Tuesday\n09.Animal (Billboard Remix)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89266499b9063465fc331fe30a83a257b29479e9","amp;dn":"Ke%24ha+-+Cannibal+2010+++Mp3%40CBR320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89266499b9063465fc331fe30a83a257b29479e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,38,100,153,185,6,52,101,252,51,31,227,10,131,162,87,178,148,121,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
