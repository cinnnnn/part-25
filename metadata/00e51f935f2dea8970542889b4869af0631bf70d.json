The first artists signed by Kings Of Leon when they started their label (the only good thing KOL have done since Aha Shake Heartbreak imo). Go see them live. Buy the previous record, Wilderness, because it's awesome, too. Spread the love. \n\nFun fact: The Features were dropped by major label Universal after their 1st record because they refused to cover &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; for a fucking credit card commercial. You may recall Nada Surf eventually answered that call. And John Lennon rolled in his grave. &quot;All you need is love...and a low introductory APR!&quot; \n\nAnyway, er, back to the Features. A band truly deserving of your adoration, in a time where that sort of thing is in short supply. \n\nFor fans of Talking Heads and old school new wave. A dash of twee, a touch of prog. Lots of brilliant synths. Rollum Haas is one of the best drummers in the world. A gifted songwriter in Matthew Pelham. I could go on, just listen to it. Tell your friends. \n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00e51f935f2dea8970542889b4869af0631bf70d","amp;dn":"The+Features","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00e51f935f2dea8970542889b4869af0631bf70d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,229,31,147,95,45,234,137,112,84,40,137,180,134,154,240,99,27,247,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
