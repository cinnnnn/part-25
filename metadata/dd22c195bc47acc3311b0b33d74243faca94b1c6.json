The seed was no longer present and would achieve 99.5% ... but no more ... causing no end to frustration I'm sure.\n\nHere is the actual avi file complete without the rars.\n\nYou'll notice that many of the scenes in this episode are taken from other episodes ... but such is the case with this Discovery Science UFO series ... all episodes are like this ... which is what makes it fun. I put this series on my computer every night to aid in getting to sleep ... lol!\n\nSince this episode has been rare for so long, I'd appreciate a few seeds please. I'll support it for quite awhile myself, but I'm not always online so please be patient.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd22c195bc47acc3311b0b33d74243faca94b1c6","amp;dn":"Discovery+Science+UFO+-+Down+to+Earth+-+Retrieval.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd22c195bc47acc3311b0b33d74243faca94b1c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,34,193,149,188,71,172,195,49,27,11,51,215,66,67,250,202,148,177,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
