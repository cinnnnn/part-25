This time three contemporary families live as their own forebears did. They must follow the social conventions of the time, but whether they're destined for luxury or poverty is determined by their family history, which is a nice touch. You just know the posh family (the Meadows) are going to end up in the working-class house but they take to the hardship well, even though daughter Saskia reveals, &quot;I thought we'd do chores when we were on camera but when you said cut, we'd go off, have a chat and a bit of food. This is a bit of a shock.&quot; The other families struggle for very different reasons. It seems that living history is a bit harsher than those sepia-tinted photos would have us believe.\n\n\n1)  The Edwardian Era \nThree British families turn back the clock to experience life as it was in the 1900s, and then fast-forward to four other eras. The Meadows are transformed into a typical Edwardian working-class clan, coping with poverty while their daughters adapt to their new roles as breadwinners. The Taylors become upper class, forced by etiquette and formality to live separate lives - which proves particularly difficult for Adele as her status as a working mum is stripped away - and the Goldings represent the middle class, giving dad Ian the chance to test his theories on the benefits of discipline.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/1988/thefamilyscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/1988/thefamilyscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/8146/thefamilyscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/8146/thefamilyscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/3715/thefamilyscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/3715/thefamilyscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/4421/thefamilyscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/4421/thefamilyscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/1397/thefamilyscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/1397/thefamilyscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img705.imageshack.us/img705/2185/thefamilyscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img705.imageshack.us/img705/2185/thefamilyscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4329/thefamilyscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4329/thefamilyscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/3914/thefamilyscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/3914/thefamilyscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/6421/thefamilyscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/6421/thefamilyscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1619 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 5\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tvchoicemagazine.co.uk/interviewextra/phil-suzie-meadows-turn-back-time-family&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tvchoicemagazine.co.uk/interviewextra/phil-suzie-meadows-turn-back-time-family&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20High%20Street&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20High%20Street&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7313594dac1dc7b2dd4abc4132d8ac85924e935a","amp;dn":"BBC+Turn+Back+Time+The+Family+1of5+The+Edwardian+Era+PDTV+XviD+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7313594dac1dc7b2dd4abc4132d8ac85924e935a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,19,89,77,172,29,199,178,221,74,188,65,50,216,172,133,146,78,147,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
