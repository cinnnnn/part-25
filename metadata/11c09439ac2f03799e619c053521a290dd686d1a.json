Players build space ships and space stations of various sizes and utilization (civil and military), pilot ships and perform asteroid mining. \n\nSpace Engineers utilizes a realistic volumetric-based physics engine: all objects can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed.\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nInstallation:\n\n1. Unzip &quot;Space Engineers v01.006.009 setup.zip&quot;\n\n2. Run &quot;Space Engineers v01.006.009 setup.exe&quot; and choose desired options.\n\n3. Launch the game through the shortcut created or launch &quot;Start_Space_Engineers.exe&quot; in the game's directory.\n\n4. Play!\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nChange log:\n\nFeatures\n- symmetry/mirror mode\n- inventory\n- jetpack movement ('Z' is now 'Damping on/off' for ships and jetpack)\n- max speed is 104m/s for all objects\n\nFixes\n- memory optimizations\n- fixed nVidia Optimus problems (EDIT: actually not fixed yet... Optimus doesn't work as it's supposed to work... we are working on it)\n- fixed crashes due to memory (when memory limit enabled)\n- fixed crash with missing .NET library\n- fixed crash in DirectX\n- fixed character animations\n- fixed saving/loading problems\n- fixed 3rd person camera issues for ships\n- fixed audio issues (including one type of black screen)\n- fixed missing music sometimes after ALT+TAB\n- updated localization\n\nDetailed description:\n\nSymmetry/mirror mode\n- allows you to build symmetric structures, see tutorial how to use it\n- allows you to set symmetry for each axis separately\n- symmetry plane can be set in the middle of cube or between two cubes (aka odd or even)\n\nInventory\n- inventory screen is available\n- items can be moved between inventories\n- you can throw out items (it has physics, reacts to gravity, can damage other objects)\n- you can pick up items\n- when you build a cargo container on a large ship or station, it contains random items\n- each item will have specific purpose in future\n\nJetpack movement\n- added damping On/Off ('Z' key)\n- movement is now more realistic and similar to a small ship\n- ship damping is now on 'Z' key too (to make it consistent)\n\nMax speed\n- jetpack, small ship and large ship have a max speed 104 m/s\n- you can exit moving small ship and float around\n\nMemory optimizations\n- you can build larger worlds now, bigger ships, etc. This applies to existing worlds as well. The optimization reduced memory usage to approx. 50%, so in theory you can build 2x bigger structures.\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nNOTES:\n\nI couldn't get the 01.006.010 version but it only adds one thing and isn't that important.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11c09439ac2f03799e619c053521a290dd686d1a","amp;dn":"Space+Engineers+v01.006.009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11c09439ac2f03799e619c053521a290dd686d1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,192,148,57,172,47,3,121,158,97,156,5,53,33,162,144,221,104,109,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
