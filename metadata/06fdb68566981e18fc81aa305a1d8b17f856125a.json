Containing the most up-to-date information on the disease, one of the most common neurological disorders, it discusses the available treatments and provides practical advice on how to manage the disease in the long term. Emphasizing life-style adjustments that will provide a better quality of life and moderate the burden for patients and their loved ones, the book answers many questions and clarifies misunderstandings regarding the disease. Written by two experts on Parkinson's disease and a freelance journalist, the book is approachable and easily understandable. Question and answer sections are provided, while &quot;hot topics&quot; are highlighted for easy visibility. The authors have also included true patient stories that will both inspire and instruct, and they have addressed several topics often not mentioned in physician-directed disease management, such as how to talk to family and friends about one's life with Parkinson's.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: Neurology Now Books\nPDF: 297 pages\nPublisher: Oxford University Press; 1 edition (November 20, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0199897786\nISBN-13: 978-0199897780\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06fdb68566981e18fc81aa305a1d8b17f856125a","amp;dn":"Navigating+Life+with+Parkinson+Disease+%282012%29+%7B%3DIMPAVIDUS%3D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06fdb68566981e18fc81aa305a1d8b17f856125a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,253,182,133,102,152,30,24,252,129,170,48,90,29,139,23,248,86,18,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
