His extravagant, satirical fiction revolves around American consumerism, popular culture, and male-female relationships.\n\nDuring his career, Elkin published ten novels, two volumes of novellas, two books of short stories, a collection of essays, and one (unproduced) screenplay. Elkin's work revolves about American pop culture, which it portrays in innumerable darkly comic variations. Characters and especially prose style take full precedence over plot. His language is extravagant and exuberant, baroque and flowery, taking fantastic flight from his characters' endless patter. &quot;He was like a jazz artist who would go off on riffs,&quot; said critic William Gass. In a review of George Mills, Ralph B. Sipper wrote, &quot;Elkin's trademark is to tightrope his way from comedy to tragedy with hardly a slip.&quot; About the influence of ethnicity on his work Elkin said he admired most &quot;the writers who are stylists, Jewish or not. Bellow is a stylist, and he is Jewish. William Gass is a stylist, and he is not Jewish. What I go for in my work is language.&quot;\n\nElkin won the National Book Critics Circle Award on two occasions: for George Mills in 1982 and for Mrs. Ted Bliss, his last novel, in 1995. The MacGuffin was a finalist for the 1991 National Book Award for Fiction. However, although he enjoyed high critical praise, his books have never enjoyed popular success. The 1976 Jack Lemmon film &quot;Alex and the Gypsy&quot; was based on Elkin's novella &quot;The Bailbondsman&quot;.\n\nThe torrent contains following books in ePUB format:\n\nNovels \n\n*  Boswell: A Modern Comedy (1964)\n\n*  A Bad Man (1967)\n\n*  The Dick Gibson Show (1971)\n\n*  The Franchiser (1976)\n\n*  The Living End (novella) (1979)\n\n*  George Mills (1982)\n\n*  The Magic Kingdom (1985)\n\n*  The Rabbi of Lud (1987)\n\n*  The MacGuffin (1991)\n\n*  Mrs. Ted Bliss (1995)\n\n\nStory collection\n\n*  Criers and Kibitzers, Kibitzers and Criers (1966)\n\n\nNovella collections\n\n*  Searches and Seizures (1973)\n \n*  Van Gogh's Room at Arles (1993)\n\n\nRead the following articles, interviews and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Elkin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Elkin&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3712/the-art-of-fiction-no-61-stanley-elkin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3712/the-art-of-fiction-no-61-stanley-elkin&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/02/arts/stanley-elkin-65-writer-of-stylish-fiction.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/02/arts/stanley-elkin-65-writer-of-stylish-fiction.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dalkeyarchive.com/a-conversation-with-stanley-elkin-by-peter-j-bailey/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dalkeyarchive.com/a-conversation-with-stanley-elkin-by-peter-j-bailey/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Reviews-Essays/Stanley-Elkin-E-Book-Lazarus/ba-p/12261&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Reviews-Essays/Stanley-Elkin-E-Book-Lazarus/ba-p/12261&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b83f5850396066ff4f4f5afa76f05a1568f1b608","amp;dn":"Stanley+Elkin+-+Novels%2C+Novellas+and+Short+Stories+%2813+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b83f5850396066ff4f4f5afa76f05a1568f1b608","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,63,88,80,57,96,102,255,79,79,90,250,118,240,90,21,104,241,182,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
