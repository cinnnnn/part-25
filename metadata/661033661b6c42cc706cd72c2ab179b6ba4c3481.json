His largely self-composed music is a blend of garage MCing, conventional rap, grime and ragga, with extremely eclectic samples and more exotic styles.\n\nDizzee&amp;#039;s third album Maths + English was released on June 4, 2007. He stated in an interview before the album&amp;#039;s release that &quot;Maths&quot; refers to producing, in terms of beats, deals and money and &quot;English&quot; to writing lyrics.\n\nFiles:\n\n01-World_Outside.mp3\n02-Pussyole(oldskool).mp3\n03-Sirens.mp3\n04-Wheres_da_gs(ft.bun_b_pimp_c).mp3\n05-Paranoid.mp3\n06-Suk_My_Dick.mp3\n07-Flex.mp3\n08-Da_Feelin.mp3\n09-Bubbles.mp3\n10-Excuse_Me_Please.mp3\n11-Hardback(industry).mp3\n12-Temptation(ft.Alex_Turner).mp3\n13-Wanna_Be(ft.Lily_Allen).mp3\n14-U_Cant_Tell_Me_Nuffin.mp3\ncover_back.jpg\ncover_cd.jpg\ncover_front.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:661033661b6c42cc706cd72c2ab179b6ba4c3481","amp;dn":"Dizzee+Rascal+-+2007-+Maths+and+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"661033661b6c42cc706cd72c2ab179b6ba4c3481","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,16,51,102,27,108,66,204,112,108,215,44,42,177,121,182,186,76,52,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
