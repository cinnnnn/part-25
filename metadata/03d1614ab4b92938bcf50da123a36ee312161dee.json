Otherwise not editing the files, I removed the silent section and split the two.\n\n192kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03d1614ab4b92938bcf50da123a36ee312161dee","amp;dn":"MC+Lars+-+Insectivorous+%5B2000%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03d1614ab4b92938bcf50da123a36ee312161dee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,209,97,74,180,185,41,56,188,245,13,161,35,163,110,227,18,22,29,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
