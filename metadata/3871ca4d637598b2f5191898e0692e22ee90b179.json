It also discusses phenomena of compression heating, the HPP in-container principle, requirements for plastic materials, factors affecting efficacy of HPP treatments, and available commercial systems. Additionally, the book provides updated information on the regulatory status of HPP technology around the world.\r\n\r\nThis book is an ideal concise resource for food process engineers, food technologists, product developers, federal and state regulators, equipment manufacturers, graduate students, and educators involved in research and development.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes case studies for HPP treatment of commercially produced foods with information regarding different HPP processing equipment\r\nGives examples of specific applications for meat and poultry products treatments, fresh juices and beverages, and seafood\r\nCovers energy savings, environmental aspects of HPP technology, and regulatory status","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3871ca4d637598b2f5191898e0692e22ee90b179","amp;dn":"Adapting+High+Hydrostatic+Pressure+%28HPP%29+for+Food+Processing+Ope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3871ca4d637598b2f5191898e0692e22ee90b179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,113,202,77,99,117,152,178,245,25,24,152,224,105,46,34,238,144,177,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
