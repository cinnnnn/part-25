A friendly reader will, I think, soon see why. Those who are curious to discern what motives prompted me to write it will be satisfied most quickly if they begin by glancing through Part IV, which might indeed have been placed as an Introduction.\n\nThe length of Part II, and a certain unavoidable monotony, may prove a stumbling-block. I have included very little there, however, that I do not discuss again in Part III, and it need not be read through continuously. A reader who feels some impatience will prudently pass on at once to my attempted elucidations, returning to consult the facts when a renewed contact with actuality is desired.\n\nThe later chapters of Part III will be found to have more general interest than the earlier.\n\nI am deeply indebted to the living authors of some of the poems I have used for their permission to print them; a permission which, in view of the peculiar conditions of this experiment, witnesses to no slight generosity of spirit. Some contemporary poems were necessary for my purpose, to avoid the perplexities which 'dated' styles would introduce here. But in making the selection I had originally no thought of publication. The interest of the material supplied me by my commentators and the desire that as many types of poetry as possible should be represented have been the only reasons for my choice. But in those instances in which I have not been able to form a high opinion of the poems I must ask the forgiveness of the PRACTICAL CRITICISM\nauthors and plead as excuse a motive which we have in common, the advancement of poetry.\n\nMy acknowledgments are due also to the publishers of these poems. Details of these obligations will be found in Appendix C, in which I have hidden away, as far as I could, particulars as to the authorship and date of the poems. For obvious reasons the interest of these pages will be enhanced if the reader remains unaware of the authorship of the poems until his own opinions of them have been formed and tested by comparison with the many other opinions here given. I would, therefore, earnestly counsel an intending reader not to consult Appendix C until a late stage in his reading.\n\nI. A. R.\n\nCambridge, April 1929.\n\nISBN: 9780765808431\n345 pages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46c7b9bd2385ca91b770ed0c8f6a943f42152736","amp;dn":"Practical+Criticism+-+I.A.+Richards+-+1929","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46c7b9bd2385ca91b770ed0c8f6a943f42152736","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,199,185,189,35,133,202,145,183,112,237,12,143,106,148,63,66,21,39,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
