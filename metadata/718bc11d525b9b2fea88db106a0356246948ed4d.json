Aside from yours truly, you'll also find: Anthony Watts on the 18-year warming pause; Joanne Nova on the climate-change gravy train; Britain's former Chancellor Nigel Lawson on the economic consequences of abandoning fossil fuels; Patrick Michaels on the growing chasm between the predictions of the IPCC and real-world temperatures, Garth Paltridge on the damage such failed forecasts are doing to science, and Donna Laframboise on the damage the Big Climate alarmists have done to the IPCC; professors Richard Lindzen, Bob Carter and Willie Soon on climate sensitivity and factors such as greenhouse gases, natural variability, and the role of the sun...\n\nOh, don't worry, Michael E Mann and his &quot;hockey stick&quot; are in the book, in an analysis by one of the two men who've inflicted more damage on Mann's stick than anybody else, Professor Ross McKitrick. For all but the most hardcore climate alarmists, it's increasingly clear, almost two decades into the &quot;pause&quot;, that climate science and its attendant politics need a fresh start. This book is an important contribution to that, by a wide range of authors whose writing on this subject over the years has held up a lot better than the dire predictions of the climate models","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:718bc11d525b9b2fea88db106a0356246948ed4d","amp;dn":"Climate+Change%3A+The+Facts%2C+Alan+Moran+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"718bc11d525b9b2fea88db106a0356246948ed4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,139,193,29,82,91,155,47,234,136,219,16,106,3,86,36,105,72,237,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
