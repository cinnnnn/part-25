Hailing from Sheffield, UK, the group had success with singles such as &quot;She Said&quot;, &quot;On and On&quot;, and their well-received debut album The Sun Is Often Out (1996).[1]\n\n&quot;Did you know that a longpig is the name cannibals give to their prey? Don't say we never educate you. Anyway, this Sheffield band, led by the sweetly cross-eyed Crispin Hunt, sound like they should be your common indie rock band, but somehow manage to avoid this by sounding a bit deranged, particularly on the opener, &quot;Lost Myself&quot;. (This is a Good Thing, by the way.) The wonderfully unhinged &quot;She Said&quot; nestles next to the blissed out &quot;Far,&quot; which in turn cuddles up to a sweetly in-love &quot;On And On,&quot; which is holding hands with ... well, you get the point. And &quot;Sally Dances&quot; is fantastic, but you won't be sure why. None of this should work, yet all of it does. Who cares how? --Emma Johnston&quot;\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n&quot;Lost Myself&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:04\n&quot;She Said&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:24\n&quot;Far&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:46\n&quot;On And On&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:10\n&quot;Happy Again&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:17\n&quot;All Hype&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:23\n&quot;Sally Dances&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:44\n&quot;Jesus Christ&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:00\n&quot;Dozen Wicked Words&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:58\n&quot;Elvis&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:22\n&quot;Over Our Bodies&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:59\n&quot;Sleep&quot; [Hidden Track] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:10","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5d1770d4613806aa3eedee9bc9475eecbd4c0a9","amp;dn":"Longpigs+-+The+Sun+is+Often+Out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5d1770d4613806aa3eedee9bc9475eecbd4c0a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,209,119,13,70,19,128,106,163,238,222,233,188,148,117,238,203,212,192,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
