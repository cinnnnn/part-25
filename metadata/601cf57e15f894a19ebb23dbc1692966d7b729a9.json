Naturally his gritty Hammond B-3 playing is front and center here, given wonderful support by drummer Willie &quot;Saint&quot; Jenkins, guitarist Larry Frazier, and Rudolph Johnson on soprano and tenor saxophone. The whole affair is surprisingly energetic and spunky, and tracks like the hard-charging &quot;Christmas With McGriff,&quot; the sleigh bell-embedded &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus,&quot; and the lively &quot;Hip Santa&quot; are all wonderful examples of upbeat soul jazz. Even the version of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; that closes the set is funked up, riding a chugging rhythm and a bed of sleigh bells into the yuletide night. McGriff could have easily gone through the motions on this holiday session, and that he obviously didn't makes Christmas With Jimmy McGriff even more endearing.\n\n--------\n\nIf you encounter errors during the file sharing, please, place this material as close to the root of the hard disk as possible and restart the file sharing (e.g. as close as possible to C: in Windows).

Operating systems have limits regarding how long a path including the filename can be, and if this limit is exceeded there will be errors.\n\n--------\n\nL Hammond, The Pirate Bay, where you'll find more jazz organ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:601cf57e15f894a19ebb23dbc1692966d7b729a9","amp;dn":"Jimmy+McGriff+-+Christmas+With+Jimmy+McGriff+-+Jazz+Organ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"601cf57e15f894a19ebb23dbc1692966d7b729a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,28,245,126,21,248,148,161,158,187,35,219,193,105,41,102,215,183,41,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
