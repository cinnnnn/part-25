Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\n\n&quot;Both a prayer and a highly articulate essay on the most important issues facing Christians in the modern world. There are truly marvelous passages in the book.&quot;\n\n--Rene Girard\n\n\n&quot;If you want to know the sort of earth from which Knowing Jesus flowered, it was the thought of Rene Girard helping me to work out what the Gospel could mean in the midst of a poverty-stricken Brazilian AIDS hospital, and the humorous and disastrous ups and downs of attempting to share something of the life of the transvestite prostitutes, dancers and military policemen who peopled the world which received me so generously. It is these people, and the way they set me free, that opened up a quite new sort of knowledge, a new way of knowing Jesus, and of knowing victims.&quot;\n\n--from the book\n\n\n--------------\n\nfor another book on Girard's mimetic theory, see this: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8360939&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8360939&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:698fa3404b245bad02002a0138d2053de91fc37a","amp;dn":"James+Alison+-+Knowing+Jesus+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"698fa3404b245bad02002a0138d2053de91fc37a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,143,163,64,75,36,91,173,2,0,42,1,56,210,5,61,233,31,195,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
