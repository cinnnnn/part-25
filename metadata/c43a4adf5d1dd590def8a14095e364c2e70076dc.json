Mount it or burn it then watch it but don't sleep thru it. It is all there with menus ect. This season they include the directors commentary and a few more cheesy bonus features or specials. Except for this DVD, Season 9 brings alternate language tracks and subtitles and more cheezy bonuses.. I'm trying every few days to upload another DVD.. So far so good. No I take that back, I'm dicken around again.. ;)\nAny problems kindly keep them to yourself or ask someone who can help.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c43a4adf5d1dd590def8a14095e364c2e70076dc","amp;dn":"Stargate+SG1+Season+9+Disk+5+of+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c43a4adf5d1dd590def8a14095e364c2e70076dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,58,74,223,93,29,213,144,222,248,161,64,149,227,100,194,231,0,118,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
