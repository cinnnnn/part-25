Because of the enormous success of Tomorrowland and the fact that it is a Belgian festival, ID&amp;T decided to give Belgians an exclusive chance with a presale (80,000 of the 180,000 tickets) on Saturday, March 24. In less than one day, all of the tickets sold out and at some moments there were 2,000,000 people on the online waiting list. The worldwide sale started Saturday, April 7 at 11am. Within less than 2 hours, the other 100,000 tickets sold out. The event became the most international one as yet, attracting over 75 nationalities.
