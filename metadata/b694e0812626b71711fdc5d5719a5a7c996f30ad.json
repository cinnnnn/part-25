When four drovers stumble upon the bloody aftermath of a stagecoach robbery, they discover a cache of money belonging to the most powerful man in the county. They decide to do the right thing and return the cash. But the outlaw responsible for the robbery is dead-set on getting back his money, and he has a stolen badge to hide behind.
