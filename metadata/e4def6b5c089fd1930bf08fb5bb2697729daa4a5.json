The omission of her name from ShakespeareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s will has been interpreted as evidence that she was nothing more than an unfortunate mistake from which Shakespeare did well to distance himself.\n\nYet Shakespeare is above all the poet of marriage. Before him, there were few comedies or tragedies about wooing or wedding. And yet he explored the sacrament in all its aspects, spiritual, psychological, sexual, sociological, and was the creator of some of the most tenacious and intelligent heroines in English literature. Is it possible, therefore, that Ann, who has been mocked and vilified by scholars for centuries, was the inspiration?\n\nUntil now, there has been no serious critical scholarship devoted to the life and career of the farmerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daughter who married EnglandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest poet. Part biography, part history, ShakespeareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Wife is a fascinating reconstruction of AnnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life, and an illuminating look at the daily lives of Elizabethan women, from their working routines to the rituals of courtship and the minutiae of married life. In this thoroughly researched and controversial book, Greer steps off the well-trodden paths of orthodoxy, asks new questions, and begins to right the wrongs done to Ann Shakespeare.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4def6b5c089fd1930bf08fb5bb2697729daa4a5","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2008%5D+Shakespeare%5C%27s+Wife","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4def6b5c089fd1930bf08fb5bb2697729daa4a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,222,246,181,192,137,253,25,48,191,8,251,91,178,105,119,41,218,164,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
