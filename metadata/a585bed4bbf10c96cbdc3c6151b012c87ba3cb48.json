He is teamed with fellow Basie veterans Buddy Tate (who splits his time almost evenly between tenor and his rarely heard clarinet) and tenor saxophonist Frank Wess, while the rhythm section (pianist Hugh Lawson, bassist Ray Drummond, and drummer Bobby Durham) swings in a Basie vein. The sextet plays five veteran standards and two original blues (Edison's familiar &quot;Centerpiece&quot; and Tate's &quot;Blue Creek&quot;) and, although not quite essential, this is an excellent late-period recording by Edison, Tate, and Wess. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Centerpiece\n02 - Swonderful\n03 - Out Of Nowwhere\n04 - Bags Groove\n05 - Just Friend\n06 - Blue Creek\n07 - Idaho\n\nEnjoy and share!
