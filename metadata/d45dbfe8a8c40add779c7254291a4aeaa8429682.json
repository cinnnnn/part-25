As time\n marches on, Gayle&amp;#039;s latest novel Turning Thirty deals with what \nhappens when his characters reach that most dreaded of \nmoments--the big three-o. Matt Beckford is reaching that\n time of life. At the age of 29 he thinks he has answered \nthose two crucial questions you ask yourself as a teenager:\n &quot;What am I going to do with my life?&quot; and &quot;Will I ever\n get a girlfriend?&quot; Living as a computer expert in New\n York with the lovely Elaine, Matt thinks he&amp;#039;s cracked\n life. But then both he and Elaine suddenly realise that \ntheir relationship isn&amp;#039;t working. They split up amicably, \nrealising that &quot;biology is telling us there&amp;#039;s no point in crying over \nspilt milk&quot;, and Matt heads back to his friends and parents in \nBirmingham. As his 30th birthday looms, Matt meets Ginny\n Pascoe, an old flame, or more accurately &quot;a girl who was\n also a friend who I sometimes snogged&quot;, and things get more\n complicated as he realises that he&amp;#039;s falling for Ginny--again.\n The transatlantic love triangle that develops between Matt, Ginny\n and Elaine is funny and refreshing, and lacks the usual angst you\n would expect from such a situation.\n\nSize:95.3MB\nLength: 1Hour 44mins 06secs\n\nMP3 22,050khz 128kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d45dbfe8a8c40add779c7254291a4aeaa8429682","amp;dn":"Turning+Thirty+%28Audio+Book%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d45dbfe8a8c40add779c7254291a4aeaa8429682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,93,191,232,168,196,10,221,119,156,114,84,41,26,74,234,168,66,150,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
