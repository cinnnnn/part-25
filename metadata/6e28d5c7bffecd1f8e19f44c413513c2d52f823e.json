Here's some background on this weird guy!\n\nThe mysterious Moth was a superhero who, whether through his own power or because of a special suit, could fly. He used his talents and abilities to fight crime. During his adventures, he stopped a kidnapping and prevented a group of villains who were trying to control the weather called the Weather Kings. He also fought various mad scientists such as one who could drain life force and another who was a Dr. Frankenstein-like grave robber called the Doc. \n\nI just HAD to post this torrent, as I love heroes based on bugs, and this was just too weird to not share!\n\nPlease seed and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e28d5c7bffecd1f8e19f44c413513c2d52f823e","amp;dn":"The+Moth+%28Mystery+Men+Comics%29+Fox+Publishers+Golden+Age","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e28d5c7bffecd1f8e19f44c413513c2d52f823e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,40,213,199,191,254,205,31,142,25,244,76,65,53,19,194,213,47,130,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
