It's entirely typical of Mance Lipscomb's output: versatile, relaxed, and samey-sounding acoustic blues with some prominent ragtime and folk influences. The 1960 material doesn't boast fidelity as strong as the 1966 takes (though it's certainly adequate), and has more of a down-home flavor; the 1966 tracks sound more innocuous and front-porch-relaxed by contrast. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:142176dcaa490cf07c154b2f88e3c5fba0899a69","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Mance+Lipscomb+-+Captain%2C+Captain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"142176dcaa490cf07c154b2f88e3c5fba0899a69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,33,118,220,170,73,12,240,124,21,75,47,136,227,197,251,160,137,154,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
