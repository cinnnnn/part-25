So when the girls of St. SophiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s start gearing up for Sneak, their fall formal, Lily decides to join in on some good, old-fashioned party prepÃ¢â‚¬â€even if it means not giving demons, vampires and the twisted magic users known as Reapers her undivided attention.\n\nBut when a Reaper infiltrates the school, Lily doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget what sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sworn to protect. She reaches deep into herself to draw out her magicÃ¢â‚¬â€and finds that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone. And it turns out sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not alone. A magical blackout has slammed through paranormal Chicago, and no one knows whatÃ¢â‚¬â€or whoÃ¢â‚¬â€caused it. But Lily knows getting back her magic is worth the risk of going behind enemy lines...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9f7d75880d611b5d98fa3a2d760bc6bc4b9d57a","amp;dn":"Charmfall+%28The+Dark+Elite+%233%29+-+Chloe+Neill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9f7d75880d611b5d98fa3a2d760bc6bc4b9d57a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,247,215,88,128,214,17,181,217,143,163,162,215,96,188,107,196,185,213,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
