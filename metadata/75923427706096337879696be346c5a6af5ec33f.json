Where's my lemmings?\n\nMicrominers is an arcade-puzzler which revolves around the control of a vast horde of tiny miners. The screen is constantly scrolling downward, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your job to collect all the available deposits of gold, silver, and coal that you see. Any missed resource represents a strike, and the level is considered failed if you miss three chances to collect. Further adding to the chaos is the fact that any miner left behind is lost indefinitely to the black nothingness beyond the screen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75923427706096337879696be346c5a6af5ec33f","amp;dn":"Micro+Miners+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75923427706096337879696be346c5a6af5ec33f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,146,52,39,112,96,150,51,120,121,105,107,227,70,197,166,175,94,195,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
