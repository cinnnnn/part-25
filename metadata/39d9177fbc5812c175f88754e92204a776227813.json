These days you can reach that speed in a new 30,000 dollar car, but what's the least you can spend and still reach this epic speed? The guys find out as they spend as little as possible on three used cars, put them through their paces and then head out to the famous El Mirage dry lakebed to attempt to reach 150. The winner gets to review the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse--the fastest and most expensive production car in the world.\n\n\nDon't forget to say thanks! ;)\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39d9177fbc5812c175f88754e92204a776227813","amp;dn":"Top.Gear.US.S03E10.REAL.HDTV.x264-SHO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39d9177fbc5812c175f88754e92204a776227813","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,217,23,127,188,88,18,193,117,248,135,84,233,34,4,167,118,34,120,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
