His incisive analysis shows how, and why, prescriptions based on reigning doctrines have caused severe harm, particularly to the most vulnerable and defenseless, and are likely to continue to do so.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Noam Chomsky\n\nUsing irreverent wit, an engagingly personal style, and a battery of examples, Chang blasts holes in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“World I s FlatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ orthodoxy of T homas Friedman and other liberal economists who argue that only unfettered capitalism and wide-open international trade can lift struggling nations out of poverty. On the contrary, Chang shows, todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic superpowersÃ¢â‚¬â€from the U .S. to Britain to his native KoreaÃ¢â‚¬â€all attained prosperity by shameless protectionism and government intervention in industry. We have conveniently forgotten this fact, telling ourselves a fairy tale about the magic of free trade andÃ¢â‚¬â€via our proxies such as the World Bank, I nternational Monetary Fund, and World T rade OrganizationÃ¢â‚¬â€ramming policies that suit ourselves down the throat of the developing world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da6e824d245df909098e566faeac7ce4c874ea9e","amp;dn":"Bad+Samaritans%3A+The+Myth+of+Free+Trade+and+the+Secret+History+of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da6e824d245df909098e566faeac7ce4c874ea9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,110,130,77,36,93,249,9,9,142,86,111,174,172,124,228,200,116,234,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
