His selection and discussion of two main topics, the problem of evil, and the apparent design of the universe, convey especially well the importance of the question of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Quentin Smith, Western Michigan University\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is a very clear and unusually objective examination of the problem of evil and its interface with the design argument. For those tired of theistic or atheistic apologetics masquerading as philosophy of religion, this book is highly recommended.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Paul Draper, Purdue University\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“David O'Connor's God, Evil, and Design is a remarkably accessible opinionated introduction to the issues. His critique of skepticism about arguments from evil will be of interest to professionals as well. Highly recommended.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Daniel Howard-Snyder, Western Washington University\n\n&quot;It is aimed at the beginner, but is also of interest to more advanced readers.&quot; Times Higher Education Supplement\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nAlthough vast and complex, the universe is orderly in many ways, and conditions at its beginning were right for the eventual evolution of life on this planet.
