Their friendly casual greeting in a local restaurant conceals a hidden and deeply intimate past. \n\nThe vision of one another along with a brief embrace stirs memories of an amazing yet unfinished chapter of their lives. Although both married with children, their current existence is entirely the result of some very desperate choices made long ago during a dark and frightening time.\n\nNow it seems the improbability of this universe has offered them a once in a life time gift to bring closure to their shared pain of lost love. Still, as with any of lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gifts, those who are offered it have a choice. The choice to either accept it, or not.\n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a2d34a90a7b6983b9252a8784e13ac3b88b2742","amp;dn":"Decisions+in+Darkness+by+Jeffrey+Miska","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a2d34a90a7b6983b9252a8784e13ac3b88b2742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,45,52,169,10,123,105,131,185,37,42,135,132,225,58,195,184,139,39,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
