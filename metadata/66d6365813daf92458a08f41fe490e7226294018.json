Normally the show is shot at 24p, however the\nlive portion of this show was shot at 60i. This combined with footage from\nprevious shows shot at 24p created a hybrid source. We did a test performing\nan IVTC, however anything that was shot at 60i was too jerky. So instead we\njust deinterlaced the source. The portions that were shot in 24p don&amp;#039;t look\nas fluid as they should however it looks much better than the 60i footage\nIVTC&amp;#039;d to 24p\n\nSo if you do happen to go frame by frame though this you will notice that some\nparts will have dupe frames and some will not\n\nCheck the sample for an example of native 60i ivtc&amp;#039;d to 24p\n\nThink you have what it takes to be a part of 2X?\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3e5a514d5b4f4b574d7e5d4c474e4a51535f575210514c59&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nRESPECT TO\n\nFQM\n\n2x\nSunZero 2oo6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66d6365813daf92458a08f41fe490e7226294018","amp;dn":"The.Mole.US.S05E10.READNFO.PDTV.XviD-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66d6365813daf92458a08f41fe490e7226294018","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,214,54,88,19,218,249,36,88,160,143,65,254,73,14,114,38,41,64,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
