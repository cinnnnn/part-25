DeMatteis and illustrated by Jon J. Muth and Kent Williams as well as George Pratt. It was later released as a trade paperback currently entitled The Compleat Moonshadow. The comic was inspired by the Cat Stevens song of the same name. It takes the form of a coming-of-age story with elements of satire.\n\nThe original Moonshadow was a twelve-issue maxi-series published by Marvel Comics under its Epic imprint. It was the first entirely painted American comic book. The series was subsequently reprinted as a single volume in 1989, and as a hardcover by Graphitti Designs, limited to 1200 individually numbered and signed by DeMatteis and Muth.\n\nIn 1994, DC Comics, under its Vertigo imprint, republished the individual issues. The Compleat Moonshadow followed in 1998. This edition also included Farewell, Moonshadow, a one-issue sequel, also published by Vertigo, which, set long after the action of the first miniseries, acts as a coda to the series. The Compleat Moonshadow included textual revisions to the original series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1416cf19d9d5a8a6c62100faf3393daaa1e9798d","amp;dn":"FAREWELL+MOONSHADW+%281997%29+%28DC+VERTIGO%29+%28Treebeard%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1416cf19d9d5a8a6c62100faf3393daaa1e9798d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,22,207,25,217,213,168,166,198,33,0,250,243,57,61,170,161,233,121,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
