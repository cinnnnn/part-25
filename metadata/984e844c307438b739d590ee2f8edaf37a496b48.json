They \nencounter a rebellious Native American man and take over the air waves \nat a local radio station in an attempt to get help. Unfortunately, they \nattract the attention of a group of scientists who knew what the effects \nof the comet would be. They hid underground in a steel laboratory, but \nidiotically left the vents open. Now, as various survivors of the comet \nwho were only partially surrounded by steel are decaying into flesh-hungry \nzombies, the scientists are attempting to come up with a vaccine made of \nthe blood of people who were not infected by the comet. Thus the trio must \nfight their way past not only roving packs of the cannibalistic dead, but \nalso outsmart a pack of scientists desperate not to become that way \nthemselves.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Catherine Mary Stewart.\n=&gt;-Robert Beltran.\n=&gt;-Kelli Maroney.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Thom Eberhardt.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Comedy : Horror : Sci-Fi.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1984.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.63 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 450 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 35 mn.\n=&gt;-Night Of The Comet 1984....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087799/\n=&gt;-Night Of The Comet 1984....: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/night_of_the_comet/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 1.85:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 688.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 2 333 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 206 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:984e844c307438b739d590ee2f8edaf37a496b48","amp;dn":"Night+Of+The+Comet+-+Sci-Fi+Horror+1984+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH246-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"984e844c307438b739d590ee2f8edaf37a496b48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,78,132,76,48,116,56,183,57,213,144,238,47,142,218,243,122,73,107,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
