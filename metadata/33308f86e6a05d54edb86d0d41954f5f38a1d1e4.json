This release 1995 on Steeplechase.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nThis follow-up to The Touch of Your Lips also has the trumpeter/vocalist joined by guitarist Doug Raney and bassist Niels Pedersen but differs in that the repertoire (Jimmy Heath's &quot;For Minor's Only,&quot; Hoagy Carmichael's &quot;Daybreak,&quot; Richard Beirach's &quot;Broken Wing&quot; and Miles Davis's &quot;Down&quot;) avoids standards in favor of lesser-known pieces. Baker is in fine form stretching out on these six- to eleven-minute performances. \n\n01. For Minors Only   \n02. Daybreak   \n03. You Can't Go Home Again    \n04. Broken Wing    \n05.
