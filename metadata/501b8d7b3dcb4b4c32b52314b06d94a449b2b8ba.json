In 1948 Will Eisner created a new detective hero: John Law. He completed a comic book's worth of material but never found a home for it. And so, save for a few bits cannibalized for The Spirit, it stayed in a drawer until the 1980s, when it was dusted off, beautifully colored, and published by Eclipse. This is that 1983 edition, ready to leap into your hands.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:501b8d7b3dcb4b4c32b52314b06d94a449b2b8ba","amp;dn":"Will+Eisner%3A+John+Law+-+Detective","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"501b8d7b3dcb4b4c32b52314b06d94a449b2b8ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,27,141,123,61,203,75,76,50,181,35,20,176,109,148,164,73,178,184,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
