The programme depicts the adventures of a Time LordÃ¢â‚¬â€a time-travelling humanoid alien known as the Doctor. He explores the universe in his TARDIS (acronym: Time and Relative Dimensions in Space), a sentient time-travelling space ship. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Along with a succession of companions, the Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilizations, help ordinary people, and right wrongs.\n\nThe show is a significant part of British popular culture;and elsewhere it has become a cult television favorite. The show has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series. The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989. After an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot in the form of a television film, the programme was relaunched in 2005 by Russell T. Davies who was show runner and head writer for the first five years of its revival, produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff. \n\n\nEpisode List\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSTARTING in 2005 - 9th Doctor\n\nSeason 1 (2005)\n- Episode 01 to 15\n\nSeason 2 (2006)\n- Episode 01 to 13\n\nSeason 3 (2007)\n- Episode 00 to 13\n\nSeason 4 (2008-2009)\n- Episode 00 to 18\n\nSeason 5 (2010)\n- Episode 01 to 13\n\n\nSeason 6 (2011)\n- Episode 00 to 13 + special dvd episodes\n\n\nSeason 7 (2012-2013)\n- Episode 00 to 14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:979d9602b9bc0a395206aa912b99a7202ebf7595","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+2005+-+Season+1+to+7+-+Complete+%28PT-BR+SUBS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"979d9602b9bc0a395206aa912b99a7202ebf7595","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,157,150,2,185,188,10,57,82,6,170,145,43,153,167,32,46,191,117,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
