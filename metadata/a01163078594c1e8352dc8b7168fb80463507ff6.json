Its principal subject areas are politics and culture. Its editorial outlook is generally supportive of the Conservative Party, although regular contributors include some outside that fold, such as Frank Field and Martin Bright. The magazine also contains arts pages on books, music, opera, and film and TV reviews. In late 2008, Spectator Australia was launched. This offers 12 pages of &quot;Unique Australian Content&quot; (including a separate editorial page) in addition to the full UK contents. The magazine had an ABC circulation figure of 54,070 in 2013, 6,722 of which were unpaid-for copies.[1] This was down from a peak of 76,952 in 2008.\n\nEditorship of The Spectator has often been a step on the ladder to high office in the Conservative Party in the UK Ã¢â‚¬â€œ past editors include Iain Macleod, Ian Gilmour and Nigel Lawson, all of whom became cabinet members Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or a springboard for a greater role in public affairs, as with Boris Johnson (1999 to 2005), the Conservative Mayor of London\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a01163078594c1e8352dc8b7168fb80463507ff6","amp;dn":"The+Spectator+%26ndash%3B+3+May+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a01163078594c1e8352dc8b7168fb80463507ff6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,17,99,7,133,148,193,232,53,45,200,183,22,143,184,4,99,80,127,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
