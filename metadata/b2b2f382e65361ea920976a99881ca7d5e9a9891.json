One of the key issues in the industrialization of MEMS, MOEM and ultimately Nanoelectrical devices is the development of appropriate packaging solutions for the protection, assembly, and long term reliable operation. This book rigorously examines the properties of the materials used in MEMS and MOEN assembly then evaluates them in terms of their routing, electrical performance, thermal management and reliability. With this as a starting point, the book moves on to discuss advanced packaging methods such as: molded thermoplastic packages for MEMS, wafer-assembled RFID, and wafer-level stacked packaging","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2b2f382e65361ea920976a99881ca7d5e9a9891","amp;dn":"MEMS_MOEMS+Packaging+-+Concepts%2C+Designs%2C+Materials%2C+and+Process","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2b2f382e65361ea920976a99881ca7d5e9a9891","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,178,243,130,230,83,97,234,146,9,118,169,152,129,202,125,94,154,152,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
