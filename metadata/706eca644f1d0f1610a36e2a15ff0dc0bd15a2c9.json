With a top speed of 186mph (300kph), the ICE was a huge leap forward for passengers with journey times being reduced significantly. With 14 cars per set, these 410-metre long trains have been produced in 5 different versions since their introduction, with the later ICE ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“T and ICE-TD featuring tilting technology for faster cornering. However, the original ICE-1 sets have now been refurbished to include more refined interior fittings and electric power sockets for the passengers. All are air-conditioned and include special on-board boosters to improve mobile/cell phone reception while traveling.\n\nThe ICE for RailWorks 2, developed by German Railroads, recreates the original ICE-1 series of trains introduced in 1991 and includes accurate controls (including automatic drive and brake system), passenger view, moveable cab blinds and 5 scenarios including a tutorial.\n\n\n5 Scenarios:\nAutomatic drive and brake system tutorial.\nFirst ICE to Siegen: first ICE from Dortmund to Frankfurt via Siegen.\nDetour: problems in Kreutzal.\nClosed Rhine Valley: the Rhine Valley is closed.\nHandicap: drive to Hagen with difficulties.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:706eca644f1d0f1610a36e2a15ff0dc0bd15a2c9","amp;dn":"RailWorks+-+InterCity-Express","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"706eca644f1d0f1610a36e2a15ff0dc0bd15a2c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,110,202,100,79,29,15,22,16,163,110,42,21,255,13,192,189,21,162,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
