It protects you from losing coins in a backup mistake or computer failure, because your wallet can be recovered from a secret phrase that you can write on paper or learn by heart. There is no waiting time when you start the client, because it does not download the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nTook forever to download from electrum's site. Hopefully this will be faster.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64cb14357f43e2c35209e69379ac90dfd6c36fc9","amp;dn":"Electrum+v1.7.4+for+mac+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64cb14357f43e2c35209e69379ac90dfd6c36fc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,203,20,53,127,67,226,195,82,9,230,147,121,172,144,223,214,195,111,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
