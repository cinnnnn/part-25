Follow my very simple directions. I give you easy to follow instructions that will guide you all the way through the Shinka system. (I have also included additional research papers, bi-weekly support letters, a 30-day personal journal, and supplemental soundtracks to be used for the first 9 weeks.) \n\n 2. Listen to Track 1 &quot;Twilight Wind&quot; for the first 9 days. Take a 1-2 day break. \n\n 3. Add Track 2 &quot;Twilight Stream&quot; to your listening schedule. \n\n 4. Fill out the &quot;DreamWeaver Personal Journal&quot; after each session. \n\n 5. Repeat this cycle every 9 days of your listening schedule for 9 weeks and beyond. \n\n 6. Witness in awe as your higher sense of self-awareness, inner balance, ability to eliminate stress, and increased states of mind expand exponentially the more you use it. \n\n Bonus Tracks: \n\nThe Shinka Guided Meditation SystemÃ¢â€žÂ¢ (Includes the 2 Main soundtracks [from above] + 5 supplemental bonus soundtracks [see below]) - A 100% User Friendly Guided Meditation System that leverages my proprietary ParallaxMindÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Audio technology... specifically engineered to gently guide you into ultra-deep states of Zen sitting meditation. \n\n Bonus #1 : The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rites of the SunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Emotional Catharis Release Soundtrack \n\n Composed and refined over a period of 6 years. The &quot;Rites Of The Sun&quot; Emotional Catharsis Release MP3 is a bonus supplementary soundtrack that you can use when in downtime from listening to the main Shinka soundtracks 'Twilight Wind', and 'Twilight Stream'. This beautiful 33:00 soundtrack was crafted to induce emotional cues in an ebb and flow like fashion when in the deeper Alpha, Theta, and Delta brain wave states, and was designed to assist you in releasing emotional material during temporary periods of emotional catharsis, and heal daily stress. This timeless recording is very ethereal and highly effective. \n\n Bonus #2 : The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Alpha Excelerator Wave Inducer \n\n A soothing and pleasurable, non-evasive environmental soundscape - Super-Learning Acceleration 33:00 soundtrack. This virtually transparent soundtrack features ParallaxMind technology at the Alpha wave level that effortlessly induces super-learning absorption for memory retention and recall while you read, study, or simply be creative in your personal space or while you work. The sound environment is set in the desert as you sit and listen to the gentle desert rain of the Sonoran Desert. Upon listening you will feel alive, awake, and rejuvenated for hours. \n\n Bonus #3 : The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Theta TranscenderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Wave Inducer \n\n As you listen to this innovative soundtrack, you will be guided into the deeper Theta realm which will inspire heightened creativity. In clinical studies, the Theta brain wave state has been found to boost the production of catecholamines which are essential for learning, memory retention, and memory recall. If there is ever a time when you are in a creative downtime, experiencing writer's block, looking for a solution to a problem etc. Simply listen to this 33:00 soundtrack, and be transported to a release state of heightened creativity, personal productivity, and can be used for super-learning opportunities... (memory retention and recall). \n\n Bonus #4 : Ã¢â‚¬Å“Clarity &amp; UnityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ParallaxMind, Autonomix &amp; Isochronic Tones Soundtrack \n\n Plus, you'll receive yet another beautifully crafted free ParallaxMindÃ¢â€žÂ¢ MP3 combined with our new, (not yet released for individual sale), ParachronsÃ¢â€žÂ¢ technology valued at $19.97 also included with the Shinka meditation system. The Clarity &amp; Unity soundtrack also includes positive, self-dialog affirmations that increase your ability to attain heightened states of inner clarity, balance, and oneness with what Carl Jung referred to as the Universal mind of consiousness and stepping into the &quot;now moment&quot;. The affirmations are encoded using my proprietary AutonomixÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Quiet Affirmations audio technology, that increases the effectiveness of the positive affirmations 1000s of times... that's 1000s over standard subliminal audio recordings through a process known as &quot;slope detection&quot; by the inner ear. The affirmations are then delivered to your inner mind bypassing the critical filters of the left brain. As a result your mind becomes more receptive to creating an inner space and dialog of peace and that effortlessly is entrained to live in the now moment, virtually on auto-pilot (Includes Autonomix Quiet Affirmations for being present in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“now momentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and remaining aware in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“here &amp; now \n\n Bonus #5 : Ã¢â‚¬Å“Awakening to CompassionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ParallaxMind Gamma Brainwave Meditation Soundtrack \n\n The Awakening To Compassion MP3 guides your brain waves into the higher Gamma brain wave realms, like that of advanced Buddhist meditators, who were invited to participate in a study while practicing the Buddhist meditation on loving kindness and compassion. The research was conducted by Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's $10 million W.M. Keck Laboratory for Functional Brain Imaging and Behavior. The study was done in cooperation with the Dalai Lama, by studying the brain wave patterns of a group of Tibetan Monks including Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche. Researchers at the University Of California learned that this recently discovered Gamma brain wave pattern is associated with a neurological phenomenon called &quot;Binding&quot;. Binding is a process by which the brain collects, and integrates the sensory perception of all 5 senses simultaneously, and binds them into a more coherent whole. Awakening To Compassion features the eastern Indian musical instrument called the &quot;Esraj&quot;, which means &quot;robber of the heart&quot;, because of it's characteristic heart melting, melodic sound. \n\n See PDFÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s for more info. All tracks are 320 kbps apart from two of the bonus ones which are 256 kbps. \n\nSource: WebRip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57aef03de7f0aaa405c0e8953cc14fb466c89180","amp;dn":"Ilias+Glenis+-+Shinka+Guided+Meditation+System+%5BMP3%2C+PDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57aef03de7f0aaa405c0e8953cc14fb466c89180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,174,240,61,231,240,170,164,5,192,232,149,60,193,79,180,102,200,145,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
