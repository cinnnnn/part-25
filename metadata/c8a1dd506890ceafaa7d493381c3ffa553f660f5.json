This is a book about drugs, sex, death, perversion, addiction, love, and god, and has more in common in its subject matter with the work of William S. Burroughs or Baudelaire than with the subcontinentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s familiar literary lights. Above all, it is a fantastical portrait of a beautiful and damned generation in a nation about to sell its soul. Written in ThayilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poetic and affecting prose, Narcopolis charts the evolution of a great and broken metropolis.\n\nNarcopolis opens in Bombay in the late 1970s, as its narrator first arrives from New York to find himself entranced with the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s underworld, in particular an opium den and attached brothel. A cast of unforgettably degenerate and magnetic characters works and patronizes the venue, including Dimple, the eunuch who makes pipes in the den; Rumi, the salaryman and husband whose addiction is violence; Newton Xavier, the celebrated painter who both rejects and craves adulation; Mr. Lee, the Chinese refugee and businessman; and a cast of poets, prostitutes, pimps, and gangsters.\n\nHardcover: 304 pages\nPublisher: Penguin Press HC, The (April 12, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 159420330X\nISBN-13: 978-1594203305\n\nFormat PDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8a1dd506890ceafaa7d493381c3ffa553f660f5","amp;dn":"Narcopolis+-+Jeet+Thayil.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8a1dd506890ceafaa7d493381c3ffa553f660f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,161,221,80,104,144,206,175,170,125,73,51,129,195,255,165,83,246,96,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
