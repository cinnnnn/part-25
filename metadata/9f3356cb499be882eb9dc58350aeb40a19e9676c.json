I took the video split it into single episodes and then encoded them into xvid.  I also numbered them based on original air dates and not the order they are found on the dvd.  For whatever reason the company that made this 2 disk decided to include episodes 1-10 minus episode 3 and added episode 35 in it&amp;#039;s place....just odd.  Anyway enjoy.  I would love to finish up the rest of the smurf episodes but this is all that I have been able to find.  I believe a 9 disk set is planned to be released in May so I might not have anymore smurfs up until then.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f3356cb499be882eb9dc58350aeb40a19e9676c","amp;dn":"Smurfs+DVD+vol2+rereleased+in+xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f3356cb499be882eb9dc58350aeb40a19e9676c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,51,86,203,73,155,232,130,235,157,197,131,80,174,180,10,25,233,103,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
