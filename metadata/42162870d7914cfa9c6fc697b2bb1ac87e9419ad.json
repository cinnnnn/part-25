Rating:  \t\n  4.4 / 5 (based on 4 ratings).\n\nPlot:\tJackie is a country boy who rescues a gangland boss and finds himself thrust from poverty into the center of the wealthy crime world of 1930s Hong Kong! But does his sudden fortune have something to do with a lucky rose given to him?\n\nOverview:\tMany consider Miracles to be Jackie&amp;#039;s best movie. Stunning in every department, Miracles established Chan as a great director in addition to his already proven acting and martial arts abilities.\n\nIn this film, Jackie Chan is a good-hearted, down-at-heel youngster who finds himself in the wrong place at the right time. Overnight, he finds himself heading one of the biggest Triads in Hong Kong. Chan&amp;#039;s basic decency sees him put his new power to good use. This is one of the most elegantly executed Chan&amp;#039;s films, which manages to combines superb comerawork with his trademark fast-paced action antics. There aren&amp;#039;t as many action sequences in this film. In fact, Jackie originally didn&amp;#039;t want fighting scenes. However, realizing his fans would expect action, Chan brilliantly intertwined three incredible action pieces, the best being the final at a rope factory.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Chan was blasted by critics as someone who&amp;#039;s only talent was directing and starring in lighthearted action films with little plot and substance. Chan took this criticism personally, creating Miracles, which was based on Frank Capra&amp;#039;s &quot;Pocketful of Miracles.&quot;\n\nCourtesy Of HKFlix Site.\n\nCast: \tJackie Chan (Sing Lung)  ||  Anita Mui Yim-Fong  ||  Gloria Yip Wan-Yi  ||  Wu Ma  ||  Richard Ng Yil-Hon  ||  Bill Tung Piu  ||  Ray Lui Leung-Wai \n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
