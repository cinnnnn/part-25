Here's the introduction...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mANnfAaeJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mANnfAaeJ&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd here's a few sample pages (I had to re-size the first one to get it to upload to bayimg)...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mAnNJAaEj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mAnNJAaEj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mAnnkaAej&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/mAnnkaAej&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/manNlaAEJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/manNlaAEJ&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTo my eyes, Dore's influence on all types of illustrative art that followed him, including comics, is undeniable. Being the huge fan of b&amp;w comics that I am I can see many people who were directly influenced by his use of perspective and the rich details of his woodcuts. Every area of the page, rather that just being a black or white space, is put to use conveying movement, light, space or the emotion of the story Dore is telling.\n\nThis file is, admittedly, HUGE. I did a re-size on it but, A) I didn't like that you couldn't make the images big enough to look at single line details, and B) it didn't make that much difference (it was about 100 mb less). To me, the size is worth it, because these are beautiful images to look at and the ability to zoom on them is much more valuable and interesting than it is when looking at the average comic book page.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e71f397795965379df7f21f9fbad1ea180f07af5","amp;dn":"The+Dore+Bible+Gallery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e71f397795965379df7f21f9fbad1ea180f07af5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,31,57,119,149,150,83,121,223,127,33,249,251,173,30,161,128,240,122,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
