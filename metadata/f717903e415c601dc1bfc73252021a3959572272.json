Le Goff describes how, as the structure of economic life inevitably began to include financial loans, the Church refashioned its theology in order to condemn the usurer not to hell but merely to purgatory.Jacques Le Goff is Director of Studies at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris, and the author of The Birth of Purgatory.Patricia Ranum is the translator of Afterthoughts on Material Civilization and Capitalism by Fernand Braudel.\n\n\nphotocopy of the original book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f717903e415c601dc1bfc73252021a3959572272","amp;dn":"Le+Goff+-+Your+money+or+your+life.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f717903e415c601dc1bfc73252021a3959572272","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,23,144,62,65,92,96,29,193,191,199,50,82,2,26,57,89,87,34,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
