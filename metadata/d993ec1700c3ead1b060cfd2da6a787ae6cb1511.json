Wood and Walters featured sketches, Wood's trademark songs, weekly guidance from Walters' fearsome agony aunt Dorothea Chubb, and special guests including Rik Mayall, John Dowie and long-term associate Duncan Preston. Ably showcasing the individual strengths of both performers, Wood and Walters confirmed Victoria Wood as a leading comedy writer and brought her subtle, sharply observed humour to the attention of the wider viewing public. This complete series features all seven shows plus the pilot - Two Creatures Great and Small - from New Year's Day, 1981. \n\n\npilot - Broadcast 1 January 1981\nseries 1 - Broadcast 1 January 1982 - 21 February 1982\n\nPlease seed and share with others.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d993ec1700c3ead1b060cfd2da6a787ae6cb1511","amp;dn":"Wood+and+Walters+%281981%29+complete+series+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d993ec1700c3ead1b060cfd2da6a787ae6cb1511","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,147,236,23,0,195,234,209,176,96,207,210,218,106,120,122,230,203,21,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
