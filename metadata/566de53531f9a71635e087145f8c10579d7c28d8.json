His influences included John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, \nOrnette Coleman, Bob Dylan, and Earl King, to name a few, and with such inspiration, what music he made during his short career. \n\nHere are the highlights of the Ultimate Experience, which should be enough for those wanting the creme de la creme.\n\n&quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot; is one of his three biggest hits of Hendrix's career, as it peaked at #5 on the UK charts. \nYes, this was a cover of a Dylan song from John Wesley Harding, but Dylan complimented Hendrix by adopting Jimi's version in future concerts.\n\n&quot;Excuse me, while I kiss the sky!&quot; The second of the big three, the UK #3 &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, was the followup single to &quot;Hey Joe&quot; and features the classic fuzz distortion that causes Jimi's guitar to be somewhat muddled. \n\nDuring the solo before the final verse, the blues influence is apparent.\n\nThe dark &quot;Hey Joe&quot; is one of my favourites, and it was after all, Hendrix's first hit single, as it hit the #4 in the UK. The story is a simple song about a man who shoots his woman because he caught her with another man. \n\n&quot;And that ain't too cool.&quot; Oh, this was a cover song, originally done by the Leaves.\n\n&quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot; was inspired by a fight Jimi and his girlfriend had, where the latter left in a rage. The song was written after she returned.\n\nThen, two songs with eerily foreshadowing lyrics. The sweet ballad &quot;Angel&quot;, originally part of the posthumous Cry Of Love, is a portrait of a celestial and ideal woman. \n&quot;Fly on my sweet angel fly on through the sky/fly on my sweet angel/tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side.&quot; Given his untimely death...wow!\n\n&quot;If I don't meet you no more in this world/Then I'll see you in the next one. Don't be late.\n&quot; That's one of the last lyrics in &quot;Voodoo Child (Slight Return)&quot; \na heavily electrified Delta blues tune with mythological and superhero overtones that has been covered by Stevie Ray Vaughn. The third of the big three songs.\n\n&quot;Foxy Lady&quot; is supposed to have been inspired by Heather Taylor, who later became Mrs. Roger Daltrey, whom he dubs a &quot;cute little heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;sweet little lovemaker.&quot;\n\nAnother favourite is the bitter and ironic &quot;Castles Made Of Sand&quot;, about the cruel tricks fate plays, such as a war-ready Indian who's killed in his sleep at night, and the crippled girl whose &quot;heart was a frown&quot; and dies after seeing something worth living for. \nSigh, how &quot;castles made of sand melt into the sea, eventually.&quot;\n\n&quot;Red House&quot; is a blues purist's dream come true, 12-bar blues tune about sensual love and how when he gets there, he gets a nasty surprise, &quot;but that's ok, I still got my guitar.&quot; \nThank goodness he does, as this is the one reason why Hendrix's middle name is virtuoso.\n\nOther songs like &quot;Fire&quot; and &quot;Little Wing&quot; have been covered, the Chili Peppers on the former, the Corrs and Sting on the latter.\n\nThe two live songs here demonstrate Jimi's virtuoso guitar playing, the psychedelic and wildly done Star Spangled Banner at Woodstock, which was the debut of the Band of Gypsies, and his cover of the Troggs' &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, where he set his guitar on fire at Monterey, smashed it, and entered immortal \nlegendhood.\n_______________________________________________\n\n1.
