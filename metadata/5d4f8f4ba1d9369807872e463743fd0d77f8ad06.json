I have checked this master copy and a backup I had going on another device and they are present both places. It seems it was an issue with the Sirius feed. I believe there are a couple other places where it sound like a &quot;skip&quot;. This was also a problem with the Sirius feed, it sounds like dropped sample from the main satellite feed in general. This only happens a couple of times and is not terribly distracting. It was captured for archival purposes only but serves as a decent and perhaps the only Soundboard source we will see from any of the Garcia Symphony Celebration shows. Let's hope for an official release someday!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d4f8f4ba1d9369807872e463743fd0d77f8ad06","amp;dn":"Jerry+Garcia+Symphonic+Orchestra+-+2014-08-03+-+Red+Rocks+Amp+in","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d4f8f4ba1d9369807872e463743fd0d77f8ad06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,79,143,75,161,217,54,152,7,135,46,70,55,67,253,13,119,248,173,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
