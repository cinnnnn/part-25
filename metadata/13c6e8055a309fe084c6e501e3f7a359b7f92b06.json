We're counting down the biggest hits in the USA on our way to the number one song in the nation.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nPaul Carrack debuts a song (&quot;Don't Shed A Tear&quot; at number 39) right next to his old band-mates in Squeeze (with &quot;Hourglass&quot; at number 38).\n\nThis is R.E.M.'s 4th chart single, but first time in the top 40 (at number 25 with &quot;The One I Love&quot;).\n\nThe biggest mover in the countdown is by a woman who had her first chart hit before she was old enough to drive.\n\nThere is a remake of a song originally by Simon &amp; Garfunkel.\n\nCasey gives a special report on the original funny-man of music and comedy-king of the chart: Spike Jones.\n\nHe also gives a special report how Toys For Tots began with just one rag doll.\n\nThe song at number one makes 1987 the year with the most acts hitting number one more than once. In 1965 had 5 acts with more than one number 1 hit. 1987 goes down in history with 6 acts having hit number 1 more than once.\n\nFinally, that 1987 year-end countdown that Casey keeps mentioning is about to be torrented any day now!
