As a poor Irish-Italian growing up in 1950s New York City, Hill (Ray Liotta) rises through the ranks of his Brooklyn neighborhood's organized crime branch, and with money from the mob he begins living the good life, complete with a beautiful bride, Karen (Lorraine Brocco), a fancy home, and the best seats at the most exclusive restaurants. A botched robbery lands Henry in prison for a brief period of time, and when he gets released, his reckless infidelities and drug abuse damage his associations with his adopted family.\n\n\n\nRunning Time: 2 hrs. 26 min.  \nRelease Date:  .  \nMPAA Rating:   R  \nDistributor:   Warner Brothers \n\nStarring: Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Paul Sorvino, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco  \nDirected by: Martin Scorsese  \nProduced by: Irwin Winkler, Barbara De Fina  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0497b0c6db0d240278a165a7355605665188c1aa","amp;dn":"Goodfellas+%5BDivX%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0497b0c6db0d240278a165a7355605665188c1aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,151,176,198,219,13,36,2,120,161,101,167,53,86,5,102,81,136,193,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
