Chasing Amy (6:39)\n\n\nLorna's fourth record finds the Nottingham, England sextet delivering another gorgeous album of bittersweet melodies and stirring musicianship that alternately flirts with Scottish pop and Lynchian closing time ballads.\n\nLornaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s husband and wife team of Mark Rolfe and Sharon Cohen-Rolfe showcase their patented vocal harmonies over more buoyant compositions on Heart of Wire than on 2008's downbeat and acoustic-driven Writing Down Things to Say, such as the unstoppable &quot;As She Goes By,&quot; which picks up on the towering pop traditions perfected on Teenage Fanclub's Songs from Northern Britain.\n\nSharon Cohen-Rolfe's delicate voice shines on the Belle &amp; Sebastian-esque &quot;Old Shanklin Sunset&quot; and the string-laden &quot;Whose Idea,&quot; which blends the stillness of This Mortal Coil with the delightful movements of Camera Obscura.\n\nSteeped with woodwinds, strings, and the occasional addictive electronics that might be heard on a Stereolab record, Heart of Wire still takes time to breathe, and explores time and space with serene compositions such as the Twin Peaks-inspired closer &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; and the orchestra-laden &quot;Mina and Marco&quot; which utilizes a passage from a 1934 piece by English composer Edward Elgar.\n\nListening to a Lorna record is to welcome aural surprises with two open arms, whether wrapped in syncopated rhythms (e.g. American Analog Set-infused &quot;Whatever Happened to Andie Walsh?&quot;), enveloped inside Matt Harrison's soaring flute melodies (&quot;Sounds We Hear&quot;), or punctuated by the sporadic, pulsating electronics that are peppered throughout the album.\n\nHeart of Wire includes a reworking of &quot;November Kicks Again&quot; from Lorna's 2001 debut 7&quot;, a version of For Stars' &quot;Whose Idea,&quot; and guest vocals by Words On Music labelmate Jason Gough of Coastal (&quot;What Took You So Long?&quot;).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3406dea93aac3db98c847651e11f97817edaf69d","amp;dn":"Lorna+-+Heart+of+Wire+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3406dea93aac3db98c847651e11f97817edaf69d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,6,222,169,58,172,61,185,140,132,118,81,225,31,151,129,126,218,246,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
