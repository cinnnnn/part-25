Philosopher of science Stephen C. Meyer shows how the digital code in DNA points powerfully to a designing intelligence behind the origin of life.\n\nUnlike previous arguments for intelligent design, DNA By Design presents a radical and comprehensive new case, revealing the evidence not merely of individual features of biological complexity but rather of a fundamental constituent of the universe: information.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow DNA Proves God Made All Creatures Great and Small:\nStephen C. Meyer, a Cambridge trained scholar in the philosophy of science, does have an explanation for how life on Earth began: the DNA in every cell of every creature shows unmistakable evidence of having been deliberately designed by an intelligent being.\n\nMeyer lays out his analysis in a new book, Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design.  He discussed his book and his case for an Intelligent Designer with CNSNews.com Editor in Chief Terry Jeffrey.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNanotech and Jesus Christ - James Tour at Georgia Tech: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.veritas.org/talks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.veritas.org/talks&lt;/a&gt; - Jim Tour, Ph.D., a professor at Rice University, is ranked in the top ten most cited chemists in the world.

Tour is one of the ten most cited chemists in the world. He is famous for his work on nanocars (pictured above, courtesy of Wikipedia), nanoelectronics, graphene nanostructures, carbon nanovectors in medicine, and green carbon research for enhanced oil recovery and environmentally friendly oil and gas extraction. He is currently a Professor of Chemistry, Professor of Computer Science, and Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Rice University. He has authored or co-authored 489 scientific publications and his name is on 36 patents. Although he does not regard himself as an Intelligent Design theorist, Professor Tour, along with over 700 other scientists, took the courageous step back in 2001 of signing the Discovery InstituteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Scientific Dissent from DarwinismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which read: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Origin of Life, Part 1: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://CreationToday.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://CreationToday.org&lt;/a&gt; Ã‡â‚¬ Season 3 Episode 9 Ã‡â‚¬ Join Eric Hovind and Paul Taylor for the first episode of this four-part series on how life began. Did life originate in the primordial soup? Did all the right chemicals mysteriously combine and explode to create life? Evolutionists have a number of theories about how life began, and on this program Eric and Paul examine one of the more unusual ones Ã¢â‚¬â€ that life on Earth actually began on Mars!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOut of this world - Genesis Week_ S 3_ ep 1\nBacteria and Evolution Genesis Week_ Ep 2_ season 3 with Wazooloo_ aka Ian Juby\n\n\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series at http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41 ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
