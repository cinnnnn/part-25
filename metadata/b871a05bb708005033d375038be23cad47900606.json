Same As It Ever Was (1994) @ 320 kbps\n\nSee file-list for full details. Everlast, Danny Boy and DJ Lethal on their second album. Even though there is no classic like ?Jump Around? on this one, it is still worth the download.\n\nDownload, listen, seed and, if you like it, consider purchasing the original. It?s worth it (IMHO).\n\nEnjoy!\nComments are appreciated.
