Released in 1972 on the Good Noise Record label, it's become a minor collectible. The featured track, which had to be edited to feature on air because of its length, has some fantastic organ and flute passages, with a few spooky and interesting bits in between! The album's cover apparently caused a minor stir when it was released.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99950639e7865424a64ee4370e2069ef972713f9","amp;dn":"Man+Made+-+Man+Made+%281972%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99950639e7865424a64ee4370e2069ef972713f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,149,6,57,231,134,84,36,166,78,228,55,14,32,105,239,151,39,19,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
