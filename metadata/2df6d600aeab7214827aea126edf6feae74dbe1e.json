I asked to have it deleted to avoid confusion when a second series with the same name was uploaded. If you downloaded it before thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no reason to download this part again. Just make sure you rename the folder and/or files mini-comic (or put them all in one folder, or make note whichever way you like, or just leave them in some way that causes future confusion, which is what I usually do). \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2df6d600aeab7214827aea126edf6feae74dbe1e","amp;dn":"The+Comix+of+Two+Cities+%28both+versions%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2df6d600aeab7214827aea126edf6feae74dbe1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,246,214,0,174,171,114,20,130,122,234,18,110,223,111,234,231,77,190,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
