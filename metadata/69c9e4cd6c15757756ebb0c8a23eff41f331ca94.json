Randomized field experiments are examined, focusing on the use of alternative treatments rather than placebo controls. The book also reviews nonexperimental techniques, including a critical examination of evaluation methods that are observational rather than experimental--a necessity when randomized experiments are infeasible","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69c9e4cd6c15757756ebb0c8a23eff41f331ca94","amp;dn":"Evaluating+AIDS+Prevention+Programs%3A+Expanded+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69c9e4cd6c15757756ebb0c8a23eff41f331ca94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,201,228,205,108,21,117,119,86,235,176,200,162,62,255,65,243,49,202,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
