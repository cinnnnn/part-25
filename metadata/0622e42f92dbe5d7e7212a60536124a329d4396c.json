This was \n\nhis second album, and the first to get any kind of distribution (the re-record benefits from better fidelity); with \n\ncompositions like When the Springtime Comes Again; Some Summer Day , and the epic America , it's essential.\nThis inspired collection reissues all the music from John Fahey's genre-expansive, groundbreaking 1964 disc Death Chants \n\nand its (mostly) rerecorded version from 1967. On both discs Fahey's finger picking is nimble and awe-inspiring, his head \n\nafire with ideas both revolutionary and musically pure. His goal was to reconcile a love for American primitive folk \n\ntraditions and 20th-century classical music; by 1967 he'd largely succeeded. Death Chants is one of the most intense, \n\nlife-affirming, and visionary recordings of the 1960s, and the clear (and thankfully not digitally messed-with) sound plus \n\ncontext-heavy, insightful liner notes by Byron Coley make the reissue a must even for folks who own the original \n\nartifacts. --Mike McGonigal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0622e42f92dbe5d7e7212a60536124a329d4396c","amp;dn":"John+Fahey+-+1963+%26amp%3B+1967+-+Death+Chants+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0622e42f92dbe5d7e7212a60536124a329d4396c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,34,228,47,146,219,229,215,231,33,42,96,83,97,36,163,41,212,57,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
