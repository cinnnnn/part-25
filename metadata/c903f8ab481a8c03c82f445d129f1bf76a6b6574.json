As expected, the highlights are those delivered by the artists closest to Hawkwind -- saxophonist Nik Turner's Inner City Unit turn in the tremendous &quot;Raj Neesh,&quot; Dave Brock delivers &quot;Motherless Children,&quot; while five tracks are by Hawkwind themselves. As with so much else in the Hawkwind archive, subsequent reissues and compilations have taken something of the magic away from this collection. Anybody uncertain about entering the world of Friends &amp; Relations, however, will find more than enough to be thinking about here.\n\n\n\n01. Hawkwind - Spirit Of The Age \n02.
