Just like the beautiful\nflower, Eyes Set To Kill has gone through a metamorphosis. After years of\nbeing forced to conceal their aspirations, the Phoenix, Arizona-based\ncollective finally reveal their true identity on their upcoming fourth\nstudio album appropriately entitled White Lotus.\n&quot;It's a symbolic name,&quot; Alexia Rodriguez states. &quot;We have a cle...ar mind\nset, we have purity and we know exactly what we want to do with our music.\nWe know who we are and where we want to go, and so we wanted to use a white\nlotus to symbolize how confident and focused we are. It's a leap for us\nbecause we have a clearer vision of what we want.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f96797c665a574a0cba7e3e143af2fcd5d2caef4","amp;dn":"Eyes_Set_To_Kill-White_Lotus-2011-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f96797c665a574a0cba7e3e143af2fcd5d2caef4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,103,151,198,101,165,116,160,203,167,227,225,67,175,47,205,93,44,174,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
