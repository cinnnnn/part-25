The father (Masayuki Mori) and stepmother (Kinuyo Tanaka) are not exactly an expressive, demonstrative couple, and so the brother Hekiro (Hiroshi Kawaguchi) depends on his sister Gen (Keiko Kishi) for companionship and care. The situation turns much more serious when Hekiro becomes terminally ill, yet his sister continues to provide the support he needs -- leading him to reach some valuable insights.
