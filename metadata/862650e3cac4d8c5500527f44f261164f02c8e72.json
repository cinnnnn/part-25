Haere's pursuit of the truth repeatedly puts Haere's life in danger, as the powers-that-be stop at nothing to keep the episode buried. \n\nAlong the way, Haere carries on an affair with the wife of his candidate and enlists the aid of Morgan Citron, an almost-Pullitzer winning journalist who has recently been released from an African prison where the prisoners where fed human flesh--the titular missionary stew. \n\nTogether Citron and Haere face up against cocaine traffickers, Latin American generals, corrupt US officials, and Citron's estranged, tabloid-publisher mother.\n\nGenre: Mystery/Thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:862650e3cac4d8c5500527f44f261164f02c8e72","amp;dn":"Missionary+Stew+by+Ross+Thomas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"862650e3cac4d8c5500527f44f261164f02c8e72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,38,80,227,202,196,216,197,80,5,39,244,79,38,17,100,240,44,142,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
