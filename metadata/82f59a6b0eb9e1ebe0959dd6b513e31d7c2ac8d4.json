Almost any one can think up an idea. The thing that counts is developing it into a practical product.\n\nThe lessons of Henry Ford, one of America's greatest business innovators, are as fresh and vital today as they were in 1922, when this extraordinary book was first published. Though the title suggests the autobiographical, this is in fact a bible of business philosophy from the man many considered &quot;insane&quot; for the very innovations we hail as visionary today: the assembly line, reduced working hours, a minimum wage, the five-day work week.\n\nFord explains:\n. how his experiences as an employee influenced his philosophies as an employer\n. why saving money isn't always a good thing\n. the absolute worst time to approach a bank for a loan\n. why lowering prices below production costs can be a smart move\n. and much more.\n\nIt's easy to see that much of Ford's wisdom has been forgotten today-and that individual entrepreneurs and global corporations alike would do well to take another look.\n\nAmerican entrepreneur, inventor, and philanthropist HENRY FORD (1863-1947) was born in Michigan and trained as a machinist and engineer before founding, in 1903, the Ford Motor Company.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy, and PLEASE SEED.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82f59a6b0eb9e1ebe0959dd6b513e31d7c2ac8d4","amp;dn":"My+Life+and+Work+-+Henry+Ford+-+eBook+%5BEPUB%2C+MOBI%2C+RTF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82f59a6b0eb9e1ebe0959dd6b513e31d7c2ac8d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,245,154,107,14,185,225,235,224,149,157,214,181,19,227,29,124,42,200,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
