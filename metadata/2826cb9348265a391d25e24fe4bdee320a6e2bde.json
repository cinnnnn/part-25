Uniting the       \n    fractious Greek city-states, he led them on a crusade      \n    against the old enemy, Persia, and in little more than    \n    a decade created an empire that stretched from Egypt in  \n    the west to Afghanistan in the east.                      \n                                                               \n    But it was Alexander's successors, the Hellenistic        \n    Kings, who had to make sense of the legacy of this       \n    charismatic adventurer. By knuckling down to the hard     \n    graft of politics, taxation and public works, they         \n    created something far more enduring than a mere legend    \n    - they built a civilization.                             \n                                                              \n    Richard traces Alexander's battle-scarred route through    \n    Turkey, Syria and Lebanon to Egypt and ultimately to      \n    the western Punjab, Pakistan, where he discovers         \n    fascinating traces of a city where Greek west and         \n    Buddhist east were united in an intriguing new way.        \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2826cb9348265a391d25e24fe4bdee320a6e2bde","amp;dn":"Ancient.Worlds.S01E04.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2826cb9348265a391d25e24fe4bdee320a6e2bde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,38,203,147,72,38,90,57,29,37,226,79,228,189,238,50,10,110,43,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
