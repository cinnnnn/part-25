For some inexplicable reason, it is not released on cd.\n\nOne of the strongest early albums by the Ramsey Lewis Trio - especially because it features some great original material!  The group - with the usual Redd Holt and Eldee Young lineup - is augmented by Chris White on a few tracks, who plays bass while Young switches to cello, an instrument that he played better in jazz than just about anyone.  Apart from the group's great title reading of Cannonball Adderley's &quot;Barefoot Sunday Blues&quot;, the record also features original tracks &quot;The Train Won't Wait&quot;, &quot;Come On Baby&quot;, &quot;I Spend My Life&quot;, &quot;Act Like You Mean It&quot;, &quot;Salute To Ray Charles&quot;, and &quot;Don't Even Kick It Around&quot;.  Also includes Charles Lloyd's evocative composition &quot;Island Blues&quot;.  ~ 1996-2009, Dusty Groove America, Inc.\n\nRamsey Lewis Trio - Barefoot Sunday Blues Tracks:\n01  Lonely Avenue\n02  DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Even Kick It Around\n03  Salute To Ray Charles\n04  Barefoot Sunday Blues\n05  Island Blues\n06  I Spend My Life\n07  Act Like You Mean It\n08  Sarah Jane\n09  The Train WonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Wait\n10  Come On Baby\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adb3897587a75931b03bfbb1be34649a96cc2a8c","amp;dn":"Ramsey+Lewis+Trio+-+Barefoot+Sunday+Blues+%281963%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adb3897587a75931b03bfbb1be34649a96cc2a8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,179,137,117,135,167,89,49,176,59,251,177,190,52,100,154,150,204,42,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
