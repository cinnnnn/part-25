Hoch Epubs -\n\n1. The Spy and the Thief\n\nA double-barreled collectionÃ¢â‚¬â€two of Edward D. HochÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most ingenious creations\n\nIn the headquarters of BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Foreign Office, a secretary spies a television actor making a copy of a top-secret key. In an island republic, an intelligence operative is murdered just minutes before exposing a Communist mole. And in a bustling eastern city, the Cold War reaches a turning point over a piece of film the size of a pinhead. These are cases for C. Jeffery Rand, the fixer inside BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret service. He is bright, ruthless, and smart enough never to be surprised by the depths to which an enemy spy might sink.\n\nWhere Jeffery Rand is hard-nosed, Nick Velvet has a supple touch. A master thief, Velvet has a particular skill for stealing unusual items. Where ordinary thieves might be content with jewels or bank notes, Velvet pilfers rare tigers, water from swimming pools, and the letters on a company sign.\n\nIn this collection, you will find seven stories of Rand and seven of VelvetÃ¢â‚¬â€two brilliant men, one on either side of the law, each with a knack for doing the impossible.\n\n2. The Thefts of Nick Velvet\n\nThirteen stories of outrageous heists starring one smooth thief\n\nThe dictator of the island of Jabali wants a baseball team, and he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care how he gets it. He has assembled nine of the finest players on the island, and is about to hire Nick Velvet to steal him some competition. Ordinary thieves might not be up to pinching a whole ball club, but Velvet specializes in lifting seemingly worthless items, and in this yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s National League, there is nothing more worthless than the hapless Beavers. He steals them easilyÃ¢â‚¬â€but will the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ruler be satisfied with a last-place team?\n\nIn these charming stories starring one of Edward D. HochÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular characters, everything is up for grabs. Velvet steals sea serpents, garbage, cats, and toy miceÃ¢â‚¬â€all with his trademark low-key style. In Nick VelvetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s underworld, there is nothing he wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t steal, so long as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s priceless, worthless, or just plain crazy.\n\n3. The Quests of Simon Ark\n\nWhen ancient evil emerges, it can only be stopped by a two-thousand-year-old sleuth\n\nTen years ago, Douglas Zadig emerged from the mist on an English moor, his clothes tattered, his speech slurred, and his mind completely blank. Since then, he has reinvented himself as an expert on good and evil, publishing book after book of a philosophy that is entirely lifted from the ancient writings of Zoroaster. Zadig comes to Maine on the lecture circuit, and in the frigid northern winter, just as suddenly as he first appeared, he is killed.\n\nThe case fascinates Simon Ark, a two-thousand-year-old Coptic priest on a ceaseless quest to hunt out the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ultimate evil. In Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Man from NowhereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the other stories in this volume, Ark flits from murder to murder, seeking supernatural explanations for the crimes. But as he knows all too well, no mystical force can compete with the evil inside the souls of men.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be2a6ab7190c09fd1e806f0e493c6575346177b4","amp;dn":"Edward+D.+Hoch+E+Books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be2a6ab7190c09fd1e806f0e493c6575346177b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,42,106,183,25,12,9,253,30,128,111,14,73,60,101,117,52,97,119,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
