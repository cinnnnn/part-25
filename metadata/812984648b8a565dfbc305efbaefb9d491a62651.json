In this fascinating and brilliantly articulated study of the Second World War, he clarifies the complexities of four of its campaigns: El Alamein, Monte Cassino, Operation Market Garden (of which Arnhem formed a crucial part) and the RAF's bomber offensive against Germany. The series originates in his firm conviction that the sacrifices made by British services personal are not properly understood. It uses eyewitness accounts to illuminate the horror, confusion and sheer enormity of war, and puts this in the context of the conflict's broader strategy. As the twentieth century, so deeply marked by war, slips away, this is the time to recognize the price so many of its men and women paid for freedom.\n\n\nEpisode 2 : Cassino\n\nThe battle for Cassino in 1944 saw the Allies' attempting to breakthrough a German fortified mountain pass without damaging the world-famous Benedictine monastery that dominated the landscape. The men suffered terribly, as a combination of hostile terrain, atrocious winter weather and poor leadership frustrated every attack.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1920 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.760:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 49:11.040\nNumber Of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 746 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:812984648b8a565dfbc305efbaefb9d491a62651","amp;dn":"BBC.Battlefields.of.WWII.2of4.Cassino.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"812984648b8a565dfbc305efbaefb9d491a62651","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,41,132,100,139,138,86,93,251,195,5,239,186,239,185,212,145,166,38,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
