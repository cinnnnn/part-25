Price, Stella Price\nRhys Bellamy is the front man for the wildly successful 13 Shades of Red, a band hailing from New Orleans that is just a bit more then they appear. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sexy, caustic and on a path of self destruction that has everything to do with the fact that he can speak to the dead. A man hounded by the death of his fiancÃƒÂ©e, Rhys is a lothario of the highest caliber. His life, his band, and his agony celebrates his lost love, Phaedra, and it has made him a very popular man with the ladies, even if they will never mean anything to him. Too bad Phaedra has never and will never contact him. \n\nWhen the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first US tour meets with some unforeseen management issues, Saffron Richards is brought in to take care of it. A veteran of the business, Saffron knows all about Rhys and his reputation and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to become another notch on his belt. Too bad fate has it in for the both of them, and gives them an attraction neither can deny.\n\nBut life on the road with an up and coming band has its problems, from bosses to groupies to just plain old flat tires. And Phaedra, who has been watching from the mists and reveling in the misery of her lost lover doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to see him happy. Being together is harder than it sounds, especially when Phaedra crosses the veils on All Hallows Eve to reignite the love that Saffron has set to ash in Rhys. And Phaedra is not giving him up without a fight. Not because she loves him, but because she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ever want him to forget.\n\nimage\n\nThis is Forever (13 Shades of Red) by S.A. Price, Stella Price \nThe one woman Winter Tulane loved and lost is back, and he is determined to have her again, gracing his bed, filling his days and owning his heart. A joint tour with both 13 Shades of Red and her band, Strange Angels, is not the most optimal way to get her back, what with the actual working and pitfalls of the road to contend with, but Winter is determined to show her that what they had was goodÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and could be again.\n\nLola Cavendish harbors a secret she is desperate to keep from the one man she still wants and needs in her life. True, the joint tour with his band was her idea, but having an issue such as she does is not conducive to rekindling an affair. Taking drastic measures to ensure a reunion is the only way she can be certain she achieves her end game. \n\nBut the lives they both lead could stop a reunion before it starts. When past mistakes surface, it will take more than forgiveness to bring them together.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b0f7f091bad68451bc0549e6f83cf977587ce3e","amp;dn":"13+Shades+of+Red+Series+1-2+by+S.A.+Price+Stella+Price+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b0f7f091bad68451bc0549e6f83cf977587ce3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,15,127,9,27,173,104,69,27,192,84,158,111,131,207,151,117,135,206,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
