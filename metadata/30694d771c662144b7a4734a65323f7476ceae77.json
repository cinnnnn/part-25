This book addresses the question of how catalytic material should be distributed inside a porous support to obtain optimal performance. It treats single and multiple reaction systems, isothermal and nonisothermal conditions, pellets, monoliths, fixed-bed reactors, and membrane reactors. The effects of physicochemical and operating parameters are analyzed to gain insight into the underlying phenomena governing the performance of optimally designed catalysts. Throughout, the authors offer a balanced treatment of theory and experiment and stress problems of commercial importance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30694d771c662144b7a4734a65323f7476ceae77","amp;dn":"Catalyst+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30694d771c662144b7a4734a65323f7476ceae77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,105,77,119,28,102,33,68,183,164,115,74,101,50,63,116,118,206,174,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
