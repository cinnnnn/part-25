The &quot;fa-la-la&quot; refrains were probably originally played on the harp. The tune is Welsh dating back to the sixteenth century, and belongs to a winter carol, Nos Galan. In the eighteenth century Mozart used the tune to &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; for a violin and piano duet. The repeated &quot;fa la la&quot; is from medieval ballads and used in Nos Galan, the remaining lyrics are American in origin dating from the nineteenth century.\n\nMannheim Steamroller Christmas was the first Christmas music album released by new age musical group Mannheim Steamroller. The group has released five subsequent Christmas studio albums, most recently Christmasville in October 2008.\n\nOn June 21, 2004, Mannheim Steamroller Christmas was certified 6ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipment of six million copies in the United States since it was first released in 1984, making it one of the best-selling holiday albums in the U.S. Since March 1991, it has sold at least 3,391,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen/SoundScan.\n\nMannheim Steamroller is a music group founded by Chip Davis, and co-founded by Jackson Berkey, known primarily for its modern recordings of Christmas music. The group has sold 28 million albums in the U.S. alone.\n\nMannheim Steamroller began as an alias for record producer/composer Chip Davis. The name &quot;Mannheim Steamroller&quot; comes from an 18th-century German musical technique, Mannheim rocket or roller, an ascending arpeggio popularized by the Mannheim school of composition. Before the fame of Steamroller, Davis had been best known for creating the country music character &quot;C. W. McCall&quot; (of &quot;Convoy&quot; fame) for his friend Bill Fries. Even before Davis made McCall a star, he produced an unusual album of classical music performed entirely by Davis and musical collaborator and keyboardist Jackson Berkey, using electric bass (played by Eric Hansen) and synthesizers.\n\nSince no major label would handle its distribution, Davis founded his own music label, American Gramaphone (a play on the classical record label Deutsche Grammophon), to release the album. The result, Fresh Aire, was released in 1975 under the pseudonym Mannheim Steamroller, in the hopes of the album being a best seller. Fresh Aire II was subsequently released in 1977 and Fresh Aire III was released in 1979. The first four Fresh Aire albums constituted a &quot;four seasons&quot; exploration, with Fresh Aire being spring, Fresh Aire II being fall (less obviously than the others), Fresh Aire III being summer, and Fresh Aire IV being winter. All four of these albums maintained the blend of baroque classical music, light jazz, and a light sense of humor (Davis is credited as playing &quot;more toys&quot; on the Fresh Aire III album credits), and featuring Jackson Berkey's virtuosic keyboard work (for more examples, listen to Berkey's own Sunken Cathedral for master performances of classical works by Debussy, Persichetti and others). Davis and Berkey would use whatever instrument seemed appropriate to the piece, using toy piano on one piece and full pipe organ on another, with copious interleaving of piano and harpsichord.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a554a0603ae9bdae99c9798de89750534892bfe","amp;dn":"Mannheim+Steamroller+-+Deck+The+Halls+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a554a0603ae9bdae99c9798de89750534892bfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,85,74,6,3,174,155,218,233,156,151,152,222,137,117,5,52,137,43,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
