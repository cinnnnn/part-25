Do you like Gotham Central?\r\n\r\nIf yes, this 80 page FANEDIT of the Detective Comics backup story Lost Voices should be very enjoyable. Lost Voices spans 10 issues of Detective Comics from #763 2001-12 to #772 2002-09. Lost Voices introduces Josie Mac, a GCPD cop who wants to become a detective. Josie has a psychic superpower which gives her an edge in her job but she has to keep it a secret. Josie appears in 20 of the 40 issues of Gotham Central so Lost Voices is a great read before Gotham Central which starts 5 months after Lost Voices ends.\r\n\r\nNote, there is no digital version of Detective Comics 768 Lost Voices Part 6. The digital DC768 only has the main story with no backup story. Multiple scans of DC768 with Lost Voices Part 6 were reviewed and the best version was included with this compilation.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n#763 digital-1988 Empire\r\n#764 digital-1988 Empire\r\n#765 digital-1988 Empire\r\n#766 digital-1074 Empire\r\n#767 digital-1074 Empire\r\n#768 scan~967 Mmmbacon-HaCsA\r\n#769 digital-1074 Empire\r\n#770 digital-1074 Empire\r\n#771 digital-1074 Empire\r\n#772 digital-1074 Empire\r\n\r\nPlease check out other DC Comics, Gotham (TV series), documentaries, Rifftrax, MST3K, Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, and more at:\r\n  https://thepiratebay.org/user/bsg4you/  \r\n  https://kat.cr/user/bsg4you/uploads/  \r\nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\r\n\r\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d1df031c101161c2005512e8639f7ba4b1fe4d0","amp;dn":"Detective.Comics.763-772.Lost.Voices.with.Josie.Mac.FANEDIT.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d1df031c101161c2005512e8639f7ba4b1fe4d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,29,240,49,193,1,22,28,32,5,81,46,134,57,247,186,75,31,228,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
