All were expertly played by the band, and all were nicely arranged. However, one could not help but feel this was a step back for the group following such a progressive previous release. And, as with their early albums, the Barra MacNeils tend to stick pretty close to traditional arrangements, offering very little deviance. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, in fact, for these talented players (just listen to Lucy MacNeil's violin playing throughout, and Kyle MacNeil's haunting mandolin); they can carry it off with apparent ease. This album did serve as a reminder to new fans just where their hearts and influences lay, and perhaps it turned some new listeners on to an age-old musical style. An enjoyable listen.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:122e75f590f41a14862e8be9b1de1844bcd99108","amp;dn":"The+Barra+MacNeils...The+Traditional+Album%281994%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"122e75f590f41a14862e8be9b1de1844bcd99108","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,46,117,245,144,244,26,20,134,46,139,233,177,222,24,68,188,217,145,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
