In 1999, Yates and Travis O\\\\\\'Guin founded the record label Strange Music. Throughout his career, Yates has sold over ten million albums and has had his music featured in film, television, and video games. In 2009, he won the Left Field Woodie award at the mtvU Woodie Awards.\nHis stage name originated from the TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun, given to him by rapper Black Walt due to his fast rhyming style. Yates later applied a deeper meaning to the name, claiming that it stands for the complete technique of rhyme, with \\\\\\'tech\\\\\\' meaning technique and \\\\\\'nine\\\\\\' representing the numbers 3,6, and 0 meaning perfecting all the way around.\n\nThis is a compilation of every release by Tech N9ne since the beginning of his career all the way up until January 2012\n\nIncluded Albums/Releases:\n\n1999 - The Calm Before The Storm Part 1\n2000 - The Worst\n2001 - Anghellic\n2002 - Absolute Power\n2002 - Celcius\n2005 - Vintage Tech\n2006 - Everready [The Religion]\n2006 - The Strange Music Library\n2007 - Misery Loves Kompany\n2008 - Killer\n2009 - K.O.D\n2009 - Sickology 101\n2010 - Bad Season\n2010 - Seepage\n2010 - Strange Days Tour - A Decade Of Excellence\n2010 - The Gates Mixed Plate\n2010 - The Lost Scripts Of K.O.D\n2011 - All 6\\\\\\'s and 7\\\\\\'s\n2011 - Welcome to Strangeland","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7c599198a6e1dbd60f2d859359222dd81a5f8c6","amp;dn":"Tech+N9ne+-+Full+Discography+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7c599198a6e1dbd60f2d859359222dd81a5f8c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,197,153,25,138,110,29,189,96,242,216,89,53,146,34,221,129,165,248,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
