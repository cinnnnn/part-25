By means of contemporary sources the author shows how Jewish costume remained distinctive in most parts of the world throughout the ages. He also adopts a new approach to the study of the costume of the Bible by reconciling traditional beliefs with modern archaeological discoveries. Starting from Ur of the Chaldees, more than 4000 years ago, he traces developments in dress during the Assyrian, Persian and Hellenistic periods, describes Jewish costume in early Christian times and goes on to show how tradition and regional influences have continued to be significant up to the present day.\n\nThe illustrations form an integral part of the book. Numbering over 300, most of which have not previously been published, they are drawn from the author's unique collection as well as from many other sources","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3974c864b9fb350ffd438c596e34bdac7c304edf","amp;dn":"A+History+of+Jewish+costume+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3974c864b9fb350ffd438c596e34bdac7c304edf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,116,200,100,185,251,53,15,253,67,140,89,110,52,189,172,124,48,78,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
