It grows out of a collaboration of mathematics teachers and teacher educators, and mathematicians, to better understand the role of assessment as an ongoing activity to help teachers reshape their own teaching practices. At the heart of each case is using assessment to make sense of what students understand and what they are confused about, deciding what counts as evidence of that understanding, and using the analysis to consider what the teacher's next instructional moves might be.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:604c69eee4436446100a4328cd8e97a914f1a485","amp;dn":"Using+Assessment+To+Reshape+Mathematics+Teaching","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"604c69eee4436446100a4328cd8e97a914f1a485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,76,105,238,228,67,100,70,16,10,67,40,205,142,151,169,20,241,164,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
