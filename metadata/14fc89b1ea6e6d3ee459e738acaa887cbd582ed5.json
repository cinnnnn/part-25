The ones that are on here are rather messy and complicated for people who aren't savvy to cue sheets and all that mess so here you are. This torrent includes The Beatles Capitol Albums, Vols. 1 and 2. Each track has been assigned the proper artwork, year, etc. Just to be safe I have included a folder with high resolution album covers for all the albums. The files are 320kbps mp3. ALSO, you will find that I have made one minor change that is not true to the original publication. When Capitol released these box sets in '04 and '06, each disc included both stereo and mono versions of each individual song on the album. I took the liberty of separating them into their own mono and stereo albums. So, for instance, if you import these into iTunes you will find that there are two versions (mono and stereo) for each album that will read something like &quot;Meet The Beatles | Capitol Mono&quot; for the mono version and &quot;Meet The Beatles | Capitol Stereo&quot; for the stereo versions. Below are Wikipedia links for info on these sets. The Parlophone issues still beat the hell out of these, but they're still something nice to have. I hope you all enjoy them as much as I have. BTW, I'm trying to publish a MASSIVE and I mean massive Beatles collection on this site, but I keep getting the message that says &quot;wrong code&quot; when I try to upload them. I would greatly appreciate anybody who could shed some light on this for me.
