She has written many books on the subject of women in Islam, paying particular attention to the practice of female genital mutilation in her society.\n\nSaadawi began writing early in her career. Her earliest writings include a selection of short stories entitled I Learned Love (1957) and her first novel, Memoirs of a Woman Doctor (1958). She has since written numerous novels and short stories and a personal memoir, Memoir from the Women's Prison (1986). Saadawi has been published in a number of anthologies, and her work has been translated into over 20 languages.\n\nIn 1972, she published her first work of non-fiction, Women and Sex, which evoked the antagonism of highly placed political and theological authorities and led to a dismissal at the Ministry of Health. Other works include The Hidden Face of Eve, God Dies by the Nile, The Circling Song, Searching, The Fall of the Imam[15] and Woman at Point Zero.Nawal has said that elements of the Hajj, such as kissing the Black Stone, had pre-Islamic pagan roots.\n\nAt a young age, Saadawi underwent the process of female genital mutilation. As an adult she has written about and criticized this practice. She responded to the death of a 12-year old girl, Bedour Shaker, during a genital circumcision operation in 2007 by writing: &quot;Bedour, did you have to die for some light to shine in the dark minds? Did you have to pay with your dear life a price ... for doctors and clerics to learn that the right religion doesn't cut children's organs.&quot; As a doctor and human rights activist, Saadawi is also opposed to male genital mutilation (circumcision). She believes that both male and female children deserve protection from genital mutilation.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains all the following books in PDF format:\n\n* A Daughter of Isis (Zed Books, 2009) -- Part I of Autobiography\n\n* Walking Through Fire (Zed Books, 2009) -- Part II of Autobiography\n\n* The Essential Nawal El Saadaw (Zed Books, 2010)\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawal_El_Saadawi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawal_El_Saadawi&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www2.webster.edu/~woolflm/saadawi.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www2.webster.edu/~woolflm/saadawi.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/profile/nawal-el-saadawi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/profile/nawal-el-saadawi&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/nawal-el-saadawi-i-am-going-to-carry-on-this-fight-for-ever-2371378.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/nawal-el-saadawi-i-am-going-to-carry-on-this-fight-for-ever-2371378.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thenation.com/article/159362/interview-nawal-el-saadawi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thenation.com/article/159362/interview-nawal-el-saadawi&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74cc54eaf0ae674b0568c755b98d488f4c283669","amp;dn":"Nawal+El+Saadawi+-+Egyptian+Feminist+Writer+%283+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74cc54eaf0ae674b0568c755b98d488f4c283669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,204,84,234,240,174,103,75,5,104,199,85,185,141,72,143,76,40,54,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
