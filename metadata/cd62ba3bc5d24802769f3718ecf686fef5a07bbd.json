Eight out of the top ten DJs in the world play it. It has transformed those such as TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto into global legends in a time when the idea of the superstar DJ has otherwise gone. Ministry of Sound has taken the very greatest of this genre, the seminal tracks that inspired a generation, and created the definitive album - Trance Nation: The Collection.\nSet across four CDs is a complete guide to the best in Trance music. Disc one is the main room, featuring gods of the scene that have smashed the charts and massive floorfillers. Disc two features the epic euphoric anthems that should be known by all, for the true hands in the air experience. The third CD is harder, raising the pace with heavier beats for the bass lovers, bound to get pulses racing. Finally disc four covers the finest in Nu Trance, featuring the cutting edge of whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s currently tearing up dancefloors.\nFrom start to finish, every standout track has been perfectly selected and mixed, resulting in the ultimate euphoric experience across the mammoth album. The ambassadors of Trance are all present with Paul van Dyk, Faithless, Above &amp; Beyond, Ferry Corsten, the number 1 DJ in the world for the last 3 years running Armin Van Buuren and scores more. Crucially the newer blood is represented in force with the likes of Rank 1, Gareth Emery and Sander van Doorn. \n[IMG]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/IMG]\nDisc: 1\n1.
