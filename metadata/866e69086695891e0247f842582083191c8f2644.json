Extraordinary carvings of green men, inverted angels and mysterious masonic marks beg the questions of where these images come from and who were the stonemasons that created them. Helen's search leads her across Scotland and to Normandy.\n\nBBC Site &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00v3y5s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00v3y5s&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTech Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 6\nRun-Time: 59 mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.80 GB\nSubtitles: merged (SRT available from mvgroup)\nSource: DVB-S\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:866e69086695891e0247f842582083191c8f2644","amp;dn":"BBC+Rosslyn+Chapel+A+Treasure+in+Stone+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"866e69086695891e0247f842582083191c8f2644","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,110,105,8,102,149,137,30,2,71,248,66,88,32,131,25,28,143,38,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
