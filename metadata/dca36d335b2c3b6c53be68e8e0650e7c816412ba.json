As he says in a voiceover, &quot;I feel marriage closes me in, cloisters me, and I want to escape.&quot; His escape comes to him in the form of Chloe (Zouzou), a woman from his past. Chloe had left for America as a successful model but has now returned to Paris, bored with her life and saddled with a man she doesn't love. Although Frederic is reluctant to see her at first, they agree to meet in the afternoons -- just to talk. He feels a freedom with her that he doesn't experience with anyone else because they have, he thinks, no commitments to each other. So, they talk of their problems and their relationships and, before long, Frederic finds that he is becoming increasingly attracted to her.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : L'Amour l'apres-midi (Love in the Afternoon).avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 37mn\n      Bit rate : 2001 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 8.66 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 37mn\n      Bit rate : 1916 Kbps\n      Width : 576 pixels\n      Height : 432 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.320\n      StreamSize : 1.31 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      PlayTime : 1h 37mn\n      Bit rate : 78 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 54.9 MiB\n      Writing library : Gogo (after 3.0)\n\nIMDB: tt0068205\n\nFrench audio, English subtitle\n\nPosted originally at karagarga","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dca36d335b2c3b6c53be68e8e0650e7c816412ba","amp;dn":"Eric+Rohmer+-+L%5C%27Amour+l%5C%27apres-midi+%281972%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dca36d335b2c3b6c53be68e8e0650e7c816412ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,163,109,51,91,44,59,108,83,190,104,232,224,101,14,124,129,100,18,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
