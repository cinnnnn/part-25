The hit series (1975-79) followed streetwise undercover detectives Dave Starsky (Paul Michael Glaser) and Ken &amp;#039;Hutch&amp;#039; Hutchinson (David Soul) as they cruised around town in Starsky&amp;#039;s red and white-striped Gran Torino, battling thugs and hoodlums with the help of their gruff boss, Captain Harold Dobey (Bernie Hamilton) and jive-talking informant Huggy Bear (Antonio Fargas).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e944d4d80004f3356c174795b2e92c7dcbae658e","amp;dn":"Starsky+%26+Hutch+%5B70%5C%27s+Tv+Show%5D+-+The+Complete+Season+One","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e944d4d80004f3356c174795b2e92c7dcbae658e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,68,212,216,0,4,243,53,108,23,71,149,178,233,44,125,203,174,101,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
