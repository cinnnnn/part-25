It was written by Jones, penciled by Truman and finished in watercolors by Schenck. \n\nThe story revolves around Robin Hood's return from the Crusades. It was very controversial at the time for its explicit depiction of Robin tea-bagging Friar Tuck, while the remaining Merry Men used them for bukkake targets.\n\nNah. I'm just yanking your chain. It's ROBIN HOOD, dude! You KNOW what it's about!\n\nThank you scanners and creative teams!
