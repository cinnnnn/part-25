Ten years after a forced separation, Adam sets out on a dangerous quest to reconnect with his love.\n\nAdam is a seemingly ordinary guy in a very extraordinary universe. He lives humbly trying to make ends meet, but his romantic spirit holds on to the memory of a girl he loved once upon a time from another world, an inverted affluent world with its own gravity, directly above but beyond reach... a girl named Eden. Their childhood flirtation becomes an impossible love. But when he catches a glimpse of grownup Eden on television, nothing will get in the way of getting her back... Not even the law or science!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63bf11eadc2771ef15228503dc4f11fb7e0ce7f2","amp;dn":"Upside.Down.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63bf11eadc2771ef15228503dc4f11fb7e0ce7f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,191,17,234,220,39,113,239,21,34,133,3,220,79,17,251,126,12,231,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
