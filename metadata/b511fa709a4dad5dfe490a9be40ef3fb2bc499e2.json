His clipped, dry-toned guitar-playing, which sound rather meagre on &quot;Blue Goose Blues&quot;, gained greatly from amplification, and his 1940s-1950s recordings, mostly made in Los Angeles, California, are fascinatingly varied responses to tradition and innovation.\n\nIn 1953, for instance, on a Speciality single, he coupled a minor key blues in the current West Coast idiom, &quot;When You Say I Love You&quot;, with a re-examination of the old Texas gambling song, &quot;Jack of Diamonds&quot; - an entirely characteristic gesture.\n\nIn 1994 he appeared at the Long Beach Blues Festival.\n\nHe had a long musical career spanning over 60 years, continuing to perform until his death. Texas bluesman Ramblin' Thomas was his brother, and fellow Louisiana blues guitar player, Lafayette Thomas, was his nephew. A longtime resident of Shreveport, Thomas died there on August 15, 1995 at the age of 84. He resided in Shreveport's Lakeside neighborhood at the time of his death.\n\nTracklist :\n01.
