From a chance encounter at the age of 11 with Bobby Kennedy to a tense moment in Virginia outside a rest room door marked &quot;Colored&quot;; from the gay kid in the neighborhood who was beaten to a pulp to the night some in my church cheered the news of the death of Martin Luther King; from a ruckus I raised at 17 that helped end a form of racial discrimination nationwide to becoming one of the first 18-year olds in the U.S. elected to public office; from planning my escape to Canada during the Vietnam War to having my newspaper raided by the local police; from confronting Reagan in a German cemetery as he laid a wreath on the graves of Nazi soldiers to surviving a terrorist massacre by showing up 20 minutes late -- this was my life before I even thought of putting the first roll of film inside a camera. Some of these stories are funny, others are devastating, but all of them have something to say, not just about yours truly, but about the country we once thought we were (and about the one we've now, incredibly, become).\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4ea8bec587a2e451ca089b7f6959a78f916f751","amp;dn":"Here+Comes+Trouble+-+Moore%2CMichael%2Cepub%2CmobiKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4ea8bec587a2e451ca089b7f6959a78f916f751","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,234,139,236,88,122,46,69,28,160,137,183,246,149,154,120,249,22,247,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
