Then he learned that his father, too, had a second lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€as a crack addict. \n \nSongs Only You Know begins in the '90s and spans a decade during which the family fights to hold itself together. SeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father cycles from rehab to binge, his heartsick sister spirals into depression, and his mother works to spare what can be spared. Meanwhile, Sean seeks salvation in a community of eccentrics and outsiders, making music Spin magazine once referred to as Ã¢â‚¬Å“an art-core mindfuck.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But the closer Sean comes to realizing his musical dream, the further he drifts from his family and himself. \n \nBy turns heartbreaking and mordantly funny, Songs Only You Know is a fierce, compassionate rendering of the chaos and misadventure of a young manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb6bfd52bb97c6902a28f9144fba0256bb741d9e","amp;dn":"Songs+Only+You+Know-+A+Memoir+by+Sean+Madigan+Hoen+%28retail+EPUB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb6bfd52bb97c6902a28f9144fba0256bb741d9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,107,253,82,187,151,198,144,42,40,249,20,79,186,2,86,187,116,29,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
