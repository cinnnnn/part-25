Evidence for this is provided not only by the increasing number of firms including such toxins in their catalogues but also by the large number of demands received by those who discover new toxÃ‚Â­ ins. This book is designed to facilitate the work of scientists interested in explorÃ‚Â­ ing a new domain of toxicology or in using toxins as tools for research. The length of this book has been kept reasonable by concentrating on animal toxÃ‚Â­ ins, most of which are polypeptides. The venom of each animal contains a large number of toxins, which may be similar in terms of their physical and chemical properties and are therefore difficult to purify. However, their pharmacological activities may be very differÃ‚Â­ ent. These toxins are extremely active, and it is therefore necessary to demonÃ‚Â­ strate conclusively that the activity observed really does correspond to the newly characterized molecule.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img1.imagesbn.com/p/9783764359836_p0_v1_s600.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img1.imagesbn.com/p/9783764359836_p0_v1_s600.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9838f46353beff8a8b00cd374d55df09b9703da0","amp;dn":"Animal+Toxins+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9838f46353beff8a8b00cd374d55df09b9703da0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,56,244,99,83,190,255,138,139,0,205,55,77,85,223,9,185,112,61,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
