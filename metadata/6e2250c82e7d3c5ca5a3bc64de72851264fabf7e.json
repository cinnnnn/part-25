The LPs, singles and EPs were initially released on both red and black vinyl, with the red variants reportedly offering particularly good sound quality. They are particularly sought-after by audiophiles, and are considerably rarer than the black vinyl versions - red vinyl signifies first pressings of a release. Interestingly, The Beatles' first two UK albums, Please Please Me and With The Beatles, weren't issued until the group toured in Japan in 1966, although songs from each were released there from 1964 onwards.\n\nBeatles No. 5\n5 May 1965\nOdeon OR 7103\n\nTrack Listing [MONO] [320k MP3]\n\nLong Tall Sally\nSie Liebt Dich\nAnna (Go To Him)\nMatchbox\nYou Really Got A Hold On Me\nShe's A Woman\nAsk Me Why\nI Feel Fine\nKomm, Gib Mir Deine Hand\nChains\nSlow Down\nAll I've Got To Do\nI Call Your Name\nThis Boy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e2250c82e7d3c5ca5a3bc64de72851264fabf7e","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+No.5+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e2250c82e7d3c5ca5a3bc64de72851264fabf7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,34,80,200,46,125,60,92,165,163,188,100,222,114,133,18,100,250,191,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
