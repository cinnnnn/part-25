Because I paid the attendant my $7.50 admission for the ticket, I believe it gives me the legal, moral, and Godly blessed righteous freedom to now give that same very ticket to everyone else standing in line for free admission.  So the theater was jam packed.  Praise the Lord!  And just think, it only cost $7.50 to fill 300+ seats.\n\nOf course that didn't happen!  But it's the same type of twisted misguided ideologically incorrect thinking that would be true of someone who thinks, just because they purchased one single copy of an album, they are somehow free and legally justified to share it with 1000's and 1000's of people.  News flash, you don't own the album, you own &quot;one copy of the album.&quot;  And the delusional part?  These are often times the same people trying to castrate me for my efforts here.  Sad, really.\n\nMake no mistake about it friends.  I have not paid for any of these albums I am sharing with you today.  I did not rip the music from a disc, I did not complete a paid download transaction, nor am I the originator of it in any way, shape, or form.  True, I pay for those albums I intend to keep in my own personal collection, but as far as today's torrent goes, I paid for none of it.  Zip!  Instead I found copies of these albums in many different locations online.  And I am merely gathering them together today, in one common place, no more or no less than any of you could do for yourselves.  Yet the choice remains yours as always.  You can download a copy of this torrent, or you can walk away from it entirely.  You can keep what you download for free, or you can do as I do and support those musicians you intend to keep, so they can continue to provide us with great music.\n\nBut one purchased ticket does not fill a movie theater.  Make no mistake about it.  Nor does the purchase of one album give anyone liberty to conclude, &quot;I am allowed to share this because I paid for my copy.&quot;  And we all know who I am speaking of.\n\nALTERNATIVE: Amber Pacific, The Liturgists, Rivers And Robots.
