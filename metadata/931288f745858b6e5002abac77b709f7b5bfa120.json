Starring Aditya Roy Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor in the lead roles, it was produced by Bhushan Kumar and Mukesh Bhatt under the T-Series and Vishesh Films banners. Set in the early 2010s, Aashiqui 2 is a love story centering around the turbulent relationship between musicians Rahul and Arohi, a relationship which is affected by Rahul's issues with alcohol abuse and temperament. The film is an uncredited remake of American musical film A Star Is Born, which was remade two times earlier in Hollywood itself. Aashiqui 2 is more closer to the 1976 version, although exclusive sequences from all the three versions can also be spotted.\n\n The film is the sequel to the 1990 musical blockbuster Aashiqui, and initially caused concern in the Indian media that the film could live up to the high standards and success of the original. Production of Aashiqui 2 began in 2011, with the principal photography taking place in Cape Town, Goa and Mumbai on a budget of INR9 crore (US$1.4 million). The film which premiered on 26 April 2013 received a positive to mixed critical reception and became a major commercial success at the box-office despite featuring newcomers, earning INR100 crore (US$15 million) worldwide within the first four weeks. It was declared as a blockbuster by Box Office India after its three-week box office run, and is currently the third-highest grossing Hindi film of 2013 and the highest grossing film ever produced by Vishesh Films. Box Office India called it the biggest surprise success of the year due to the magnitude of its' success. The soundtrack to the film became very popular after its release; the songs &quot;Tum Hi Ho&quot; and &quot;Sun Raha Hai&quot; topped the charts across various platforms in India.\n\nAUDIO:\nFormat:mp3\nMusic:lossless\nBitrate:256kbps\nSound language:Hindi\n\n The 10 songs of the film soundtrack were mostly composed by Jeet Ganguly, although Mithoon composed two songs whereas Ankit Tiwari and GOurav Bansal composed 1 song each. Irshad Kamil wrote lyrics for most of songs on the album. Sandeep Nath wrote both versions of &quot;Sun Raha Hai&quot;, while Mithoon wrote &quot;Tum Hi Ho&quot;. Arijit Singh sang six of the songs on the album. The music became very popular after its release on 8 April 2013, with songs &quot;Tum Hi Ho&quot; and &quot;Sun Raha Hai&quot; topping the charts across various platforms in India.\n\n Aashiqui 2's soundtrack received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised the songs &quot;Tum Hi Ho&quot; and both versions of &quot;Sun Raha Hai&quot;. &quot;Tum Hi Ho&quot; received widespread online recognition.The Times of India rated the album 5 out of 5 stars and wrote, &quot;Aashiqui 2 tries, and succeeds to some extent in matching the repeat-values freshness and allure of the original. And while it is unfair to compare a sequel to the original, it needs to be said that each should be seen for its own merit.&quot;Glamsham gave a rating of 4 stars out of 5 and said, &quot;It is indeed an exhilarating experience listening to the songs of Aashiqui 2 and in this age of mundane and average/repetitive musical fares that are being churned out, the audio of Aashiqui 2 is surely a treat for all music buffs. 'Tum Hi Ho' and 'Sunn Raha Hai' (both versions) are our favourites, but &quot;Chahun Main Ya Naa&quot; and &quot;Piya Aaye Na&quot; end up as a close second. A chartbusting musical experience indeed.\n\n Koimoi rated the album 3 out of 5 and said, &quot;Aashiqui 2 is an album that had set its heart in the right place and wanted to accomplish what Aashiqui did musically. It has the ingredients in place though at times one gets an impression that the recipe could have been a tad better. One waits to see if the soundtrack would indeed turn out to be memorable for a lifetime, more so since Bhatts had musically created a high standard with Aashiqui&quot;.Planet Bollywood gave a rating of 6.5 out of 10 and praised the contributions of Ankit Tiwari and Mithoon shines with their single compositions, but believed that the remaining songs by Jeet Ganguly lacked freshness and were too repetitive apart from &quot;Chahun Main Ya Na&quot;,&quot;Hum Mar Jayenge&quot; and &quot;Milne Hai Mujhse Aayi&quot;.\n\n\nMarketing and release:\n\n The first teaser was released on 22 March 2013, and was well received by critics and audiences.Unlike other films whose theatrical trailers are released first, the makers of the film chose to release the songs before the trailer. The first song, &quot;Tum Hi Ho&quot;, was released on 23 March 2013 to unanimous critical reception from critics and became very popular among the audiences. The song became an instant hit with approximately 2 million views on Youtube within 10 days of release, which helped in the marketing of the film.Various versions of the song were uploaded by amateur singers, guitarists and DJs on social networking sites. It has been trending on Twitter and YouTube since its launch.\n\n The film's preview poster showing Aditya and Shraddha under a jacket in a rain-drenched street with the streetlight casting a glow was released along with music on 8 April 2013. At the music release event, Aditya and Shraddha recreated the scene from Aashiqui from under a jacket (much like the poster) on the stage. The theatrical trailer was released in mid-April 2013, two weeks before the film's release, and was well received by critics and audiences.\n\n Unlike most Bollywood films which indulge in months of promotion before the release, Aashiqui 2 had less than three weeks for promotion before its release. A music concert where singers (who sang songs in the soundtrack album) performed to their respective songs was organised to promote the film. The makers of the film launched the Aashiqui 2 jackets, as seen in the film's poster. Statues resembling the signature image of the couple hiding under the jacket were placed inside various theatres.Due to the romantic theme of the film, it was originally planned for a Valentine's day release on 14 February 2013, but this was postponed because of production delays. The film's new release date was 10 May 2013, but it was released a fortnight early on 26 April 2013 in over 2800 screens across India.The film was not released in key markets such as UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nReception:\n\n The film received positive to mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances, chemistry between the lead pair, and the music. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated the film 4 out of 5 stars, stating that it &quot;brings romance back on the Hindi screen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ intense, pure, selfless and heart wrenching. A stirring account with brilliant moments, bravura performances, strong emotional quotient and addictive music, this one's an absolute must watch for the romantics.&quot; He praised the lead cast's performances, writing that &quot; ... Aditya Roy Kapur's depiction of the intense character is outstanding ... [which] clearly demonstrates his potency as an artiste of caliber and competence. Shraddha also gets to sink her teeth into this challenging character and the attractive youngster is simply amazing, more so towards the demanding moments in the second hour. Furthermore, the chemistry between Aditya and Shraddha is incredible.&quot;[40] Martin D Souza of Glamsham gave it 4/5 stars.[41] Indiatimes gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and said, &quot;Suri pitches the story with old-world romance, high-drama and well-crafted heart-breaking moments.&quot;[42] Indo-Asian News Service rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, &quot;Director Mohit Suri traverses the angst-soaked territory with a sincere and deep understanding of the dynamics that destroy love and trust between couples in the glamorous and competitive profession&quot;, and that, &quot;Aashiqui 2 makes us grateful for the movement of the love story away from the standard Romeo &amp; Juliet format into the dark destructive domain of A Star Is Born.&quot;[43] Komal Nahta gave it 3.5/5 stars stating that, On the whole, Aashiqui 2 is an entertaining film with hit music and the sacrificing nature of the heroine as it biggest trump cards.&quot; [44]\n\n The film also received some mixed reactions from critics. Writing for Hindustan Times, Anupama Chopra rated the film 2.5 out of 5 and believed that the film didn't fulfill its potential, but said, &quot;It's an interesting scenario and Suri and his actors set it up well. Aditya gives Rahul's angst a certain charm. He is earnest and broken. And the real triumph here is Shraddha, whose porcelain face has a haunting vulnerability. She's very good as the woman in the throes of a grand passion who believes that love will show the way.&quot;[45] Resham Sengar rated the film 2.5 and questioned the logic behind the script and believed that several of the scenes either dragged on excessively or were too abrupt, which affected the quality of the entire film.[46] India Today also gave the film a rating of 2.5 stars out of four, and argued that the film was only a success because of its soundtrack, saying that the film &quot;merely banks on the power of saleable music and the novelty of a fresh cast to enable brothers Bhatt, Mahesh and Mukesh, [to] make maximum moolah within minimum budget as they have done all along.&quot;[47]\n\nBox office:\n\n On its opening day, Aashiqui 2 collected about INR5.25 crore (US$800,000)and collected INR17.92 crore (US$2.7 million) during its first weekend.The film collected INR34.65 crore (US$5.3 million) in its first week.
