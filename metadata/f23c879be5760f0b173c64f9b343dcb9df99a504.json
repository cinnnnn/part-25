Also: the referendum in Crimea looms for Ukraine, Shields and Brooks on Crimea consequences and CIA accusations, a second look at an American Graduate story about Goodwill and the new book 'The Snowden Files' reveals the man who revealed NSA secrets.\n\nTorrents by CitizenD for the PBS NewsHour are added daily. \n\nDownload may be slow, I recommend you download the SDTV version if you want your news quickly.\n\nAny torrent I put up, I host for at least three weeks, so there will always be at least one seeder for that time even if it shows 0 seeders. I am there uploading nonetheless.\n\nThis is a group effort, please seed people, a few days won't kill you.\n\n\nBe more PBS!\n\nSupport your local PBS station.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f23c879be5760f0b173c64f9b343dcb9df99a504","amp;dn":"PBS.NewsHour.2014.03.14.Friday.720p.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f23c879be5760f0b173c64f9b343dcb9df99a504","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,60,135,155,229,118,15,11,23,60,100,249,179,67,220,185,223,153,165,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
