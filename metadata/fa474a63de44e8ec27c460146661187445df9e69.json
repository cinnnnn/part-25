Only, Elle doesn't remember any of this. MIND THE GAP, the new series by the Eisner Award-winning writer JIM McCANN (Return of the Dapper Men), is a mystery with a paranormal twist. Elle, in a spirit form detached from her comatose body, must not only unravel the mystery of her attacker's identity and motive but her entire life as well. Who can she trust, in both this word and in the gap she exists in that lies between life and death? Filled with twists and turns, Elle's life isn't the only one turned upside down by the attack on her life. Deceit, secrets, and hidden agendas are everywhere in a story where everyone is a suspect, and no one is innocent. USAToday hails it as an &quot;anxiously anticipated modern thriller.&quot;\n\nMind the Gap Vol. 2: Wish You Were Here (Issues 6-10)\nNew threats arise as the curtains pull back to reveal some of the most shocking secrets surrounding the mystery behind the attack on Elle Peterssen. Meanwhile, what is her connection to a 10-year-old girl who claims to actually be Elle's mind trapped in this girl's body? All of this plus the acclaimed silent issue &quot;speechless&quot; and the unmasking that changes the entire series.\n\nThanks goes to Tarutaru and theProletariat for this release.\n\nMind the Gap #11: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8923264&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8923264&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
