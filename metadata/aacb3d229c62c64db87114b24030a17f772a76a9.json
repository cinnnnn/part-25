In this book, Tim Knight provides an exhaustive analysis of financial market behavior prior, during, and following tumultuous events since 1600.\n\nMaking copious use of charts and basic technical analysis, Knight demonstrates how external shocks tend to create extreme reactions in the financial markets and how these predictable reactions provide opportunities for investors and traders to profit. Knight traverses five centuries of financial market history, from Tulipmania in the 1600s to the contemporary sovereign debt crisis. He looks at each event from the prism of the financial markets, examining the market climate prior to the event, during the event, and following the event.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aacb3d229c62c64db87114b24030a17f772a76a9","amp;dn":"Panic%2C+Prosperity%2C+and+Progress+by+Timothy+Knight.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aacb3d229c62c64db87114b24030a17f772a76a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,203,61,34,156,98,198,77,184,113,20,178,64,48,161,127,119,42,118,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
