Do you have a huge library on iTunes and cant transfer it to another machine? This will fix that.\n\nYou can also go download Rhapsody. Rhaposody is only about 14 bucks a mo but will let you download any music to your computer for offline listening. You can then run sound taxi to strip that music of its DRM and do what you want with it. Pretty simple. Dedicated downloads supper fast way to get what you want and as much of it as your hard drive can hold.\n\nPlease help me seed this file!\nIt is small at only 7.5 megs or so.\nThat is compressed. Uncompressed the file is still like 7.65.\n\n\nInhalation:\n\nOpen file with winZip or 7zip.\n\nExtract files anywhere on C:\n\nRun the installer. Install on C: (Will not run from anything other than C: due to the  keygen reg entries pointing at C: only)\nDO NOT RUN THE PROGRAM OR YOU WILL HAVE TO START OVER!\n\nNow run the KeyGen. This will make 3 registry entries and fill in the registration info.\n\nNow run the program and point it at the folder containing the files you would like to convert and set up an output folder.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nSEED THIS! Share it! give it to your friends that use iTunes or Rhapsody!\nPlease note in the info file: you will be able to convert ANY kind of DRM not just Rhopsody (Real Player DRM) and iTunes.\n\n\n\nInfo File:\n===============================================================================\nSoundTaxi Platinum v1.3.5\n-------------------------\n\nMore info:\n - http://www.soundtaxi.info/\n\nScreenshot:\n - http://img187.imageshack.us/img187/9568/screenue8.gif\n\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nEasily convert DRM protected music files and various audio files to unprotected MP3, CD, iPod and other MP3 player file formats at high speed and CD quality- legally.\n\nSoundTaxi unprotects and converts music files from:\n\n    * iTunes\n    * Napster\n    * Yahoo Music\n    * MusicMatch\n    * MSNMusic\n    * MusicLoad\n    * Rhapsody\n    * MTV / urge\n    * MusicNow\n    * BuyMusic\n    * AOL Music\n    * Virgin Digital\n    * Sony Connect\n    * Beon Music\n    * Peer Impact\n    * iMusica\n    * Wal-Mart\n    * AOL MusicNow\n    * connect-europe\n    * akuma\n    * Listen JP\n    * ongen\n    * hmv\n    * Bigpond Music\n    * Soundbuzz\n    * digirama\n    * imusica\n    * cdigix\n    * cingular mMode\n    * puretracks\n    * metro tunes\n    * fnac\n\n\nSupported file formats: (in protected/unprotected; out unprotected)\n\n  \t  wma \t  m4p \t  aac\n  \t  mp3 \t  wav \t  ogg\n  \t  mp4 \t  snd \t  aif\n  \t  any format Media Player supports\n\nWith just a few mouse clicks you can enjoy all your protected songs on iPod, any other MP3 player, CD player, mobile phone or PC - without any restrictions or DRM protection.\n\nSoundTaxi is easy to install and use with a very handy and clear user interface.\n\nIt lets you choose the compression level and it preserves ID3 tags for artist, album, title names etc.\n\nA batch mode and the drag&amp;drop function for folders and files allow to convert and unprotect large music collections with just 1 click.\n\nFeature list:\n\n - very easy to use and install\n\n - converts any song that can be played with Media Player to MP3, AAC, WAV etc\n   for use with iPod, any other MP3 player, CD player, mobile phone or PC\n\n - unprotects practically all DRM audio files\n\n - unprotects and converts songs for use with iPod, any other MP3 player,\n   CD player, mobile phone or PC\n\n - converted songs have NO DRM restriction anymore\n\n - preserves ID3 tags for artist, album, title names etc.\n\n - batch mode for converting or unprotecting large song collections\n\n - allows to convert complete folder structures and recreates these structures on output\n\n - selectable compression level and output format\n\n - very fast conversion, up to 13x the playback speed\n\n - can convert in HIFI and CD quality\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\nWindows XP x32 or Windows 2003 x32\n256 Megabyte RAM\nMicrosoft\\&amp;#039;s MediaPlayer 7, 8, 9 or 10 installed ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82b03f8e9af7ed81ac76849402382d744f4867cb","amp;dn":"Sound+Taxi+%2B+KeyGen+%3D+Removes+DRM+from+media%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82b03f8e9af7ed81ac76849402382d744f4867cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,176,63,142,154,247,237,129,172,118,132,148,2,56,45,116,79,72,103,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
