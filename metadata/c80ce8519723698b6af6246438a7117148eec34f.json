Our aim is to help to define the concept of &quot;international terrorism&quot;, which has been in great focus since the brutal terrorist attack against the United States of America on 11 September 2001, a day wickedness which has destroyed the lives of thousands of innocent people.Those who use terrorism in the name of Islam, in fact, have no other faculty except ignorance and hatred.
