There are two terrific Easter Basket projects, one made from a tissue box and the other from coffee filters.\nAn easy-to-make but dramatic project is the Easter Corsage, a perfect Easter gift. In the Easter decorations category there is the Basket of Flowers Door Wreath, and a great idea for a bouquet made of Eggshell Flowers. And, for your Easter table, the Bunny and Basket Place Cards are adorable.\nEach of the crafts is made from things found around the house and simple, inexpensive craft items. The crafts can make very satisfying parent/child projects for the younger ones, while older children can do them on their own.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1503fc467ecc8e8c5ee99ba8d5724f6fddecca70","amp;dn":"All+New+Crafts+For+Easter+%28All+New+Holiday+Crafts+For+Kids%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1503fc467ecc8e8c5ee99ba8d5724f6fddecca70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,3,252,70,126,204,142,140,94,233,155,168,213,114,79,111,221,236,202,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
