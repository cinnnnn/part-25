This is 01 thru 15. The next will be 16-thru30 and so on.  Here is the top 15:\n\n01. Fleet Foxes - Sun Giant EP/Fleet Foxes\n02. Portishead - Third \n03. No Age - Nouns\n04. Cut Copy - In Ghost Colours\n05. Deerhunter - Microcastle\n06. TV On The Radio - Dear Science\n07. Vampire Weekend - Vampire Weekend \n08. M83 - Saturdays Youth\n09. Hercules and Love Affair - Hercules and Love Affair \n10. DJ/rupture-Uproot\n11. Lil Wayne - Tha Carter III \n12. Lindstrom - Where You Go I Go Too\n13. Erykah Badu - New Amerykah Part One (4th World War) \n14. Air France - No Way Down\n15. Crystal Castles - Crystal Castles\n\nAs the list clearly demonstrates - it has been another amazing year in music - apart from the usual mainstream commercial drivel that dominates the corporate airwaves. \n\nI want to thank everyone in the PB community for making this one of the best Torrent site anywhere. May you all have a prosperous, healthy and transformational 2009. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:795f9590230117a35980b880af57378958f80ac3","amp;dn":"Pitchfork%5C%27s+Top+50+Albums+for+2008+%2801-15%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"795f9590230117a35980b880af57378958f80ac3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,95,149,144,35,1,23,163,89,128,184,128,175,87,55,137,88,248,10,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
