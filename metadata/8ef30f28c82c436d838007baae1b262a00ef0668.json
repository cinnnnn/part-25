From boyhood in segregated America to becoming one of the world's opinion-formers, Ashe's story is told poignantly by his brother Johnnie, along with friends Stan Smith and Donald Dell, and rivals like Ilie Nastase. This is far more than a just a story of how a man conquered the world of tennis. Ashe's life spans America's Civil Rights struggle, the ending of South Africa's system of apartheid and his creation of an awareness of the disease that would eventually kill him: AIDS. Serena Williams, Martina Navratilova, John McEnroe and Andy Murray all explain Arthur's legacy and their own personal debt to the man. It is not surprising that when Nelson Mandela was finally released from prison, one of the first people he asked to meet was Arthur Ashe.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;fab2939d92bab6ced4cb&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2009Kbps)\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~132Kbps)\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59 mins\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 925 MB\nSource: HDTV\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ef30f28c82c436d838007baae1b262a00ef0668","amp;dn":"Arthur.Ashe.More.Than.a.Champion.720p.HDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ef30f28c82c436d838007baae1b262a00ef0668","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,243,15,40,200,44,67,109,131,128,7,186,174,27,38,42,0,239,6,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
