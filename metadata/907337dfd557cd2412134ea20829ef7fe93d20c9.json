My Second Try (02:46)\n\nWaterdeep has always been a band unafraid to embrace the 70s (notably on EveryoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Beautiful), and making music decades behind the trends has never sounded so good Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or so original. Not that others havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spiced up their music these days by tipping the hat to Jackson Browne, etc., but Waterdeep has been doing it long enough that it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sound like a band searching for a gimmick to latch on to.\n\nPink &amp; Blue may be the best 70s album made in the last year. Waterdeep have all but shed their rock and folk and embraced what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always suspected was at their core: pop. I heartily welcome it. Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Be fineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a reassuring refrain for such times as these. We all need a pat on the back sometimes. This time maybe more than others.\n\nWaterdeep is equal parts Don and Lori Chaffer, a husband and wife duo to contend with. They have little ones at home, but where that might normally preempt creative output, it only fuels the Chaffers. Pink &amp; Blue is touted as Ã¢â‚¬Å“An Activity Book for Grown-Ups!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Where have I put my crayons again?) ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a metaphor, unfortunately. (Damn.) The back cover reads: Ã¢â‚¬Å“To be perfectly honest, these are just songs trying to pass themselves off as activities.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Such silliness is respectable. Music doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to be doom and gloom and academic and clinical. It can be fun.\n\nThe album is broken up into a double EP. One disc is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blue CDÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and one is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pink CDÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The Chaffers each bear considerable talent vocally and instrumentally, and so they decided why not let each other have a little space of their own? The colors are self explanatory, blue for boys, pink for girls. They are equally strong.\n\nEven so, Waterdeep doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fall into the trap of trying to make a good record thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too rigid. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done this too many times to make that mistake. Pink &amp; Blue is equal parts frivolity and good production. Some records lack focus, some leave no room to relax. Waterdeep walks a line between the two extremes. On both discs there are afterthoughts: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Enter MagicianÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at 58 seconds, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Party RepriseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at 17 seconds. It breaks things up, yet they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem like filler. They support the talent, tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Right BeforeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“OhÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which are college radio ready.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:907337dfd557cd2412134ea20829ef7fe93d20c9","amp;dn":"Waterdeep+-+Pink+%26amp%3B+Blue+%5B2008%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"907337dfd557cd2412134ea20829ef7fe93d20c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,115,55,223,213,87,205,36,18,19,78,162,8,41,239,127,233,61,32,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
