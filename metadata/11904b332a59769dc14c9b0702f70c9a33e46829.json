Robb - Eve Dallas 23 - Survivor In Death-viny\n\nThe only thing that kept young Nixie Swisher from suffering the same fate as her parents, brother, housekeeper, and young sleepover companion was the impulsive nine-year-old's desire for an illicit orange fizzy at 2 a.m. Taking the bereft girl under her wing, Eve is determined to make sure the killers don't get the chance to finish their lethal job. From the first, however, the investigation is baffling. The Swishers were a nice family, living on the Upper West Side in a house with an excellent security system. Ordinary almost to a fault, they seemed unlikely victims for this carefully planned and executed crime. Valuables at the scene were left untouched, there was no sign of vandalism -- just the corpses of five people murdered in their sleep.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11904b332a59769dc14c9b0702f70c9a33e46829","amp;dn":"J.D.+Robb+-+Eve+Dallas+23+-+Survivor+In+Death-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11904b332a59769dc14c9b0702f70c9a33e46829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,144,75,51,42,89,118,157,193,76,155,7,2,247,12,154,51,228,104,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
