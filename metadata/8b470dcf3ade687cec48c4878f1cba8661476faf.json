With dimensions of 14 cm ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ 14 \ncm ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ 3.8 cm (5.5in ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ 5.5in ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ 1.5in), the NEC PC Engine holds the record for the \nworld's smallest game console ever made. (Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition \n(2008))\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Telegames released a slightly altered version of the US \nmodel simply as the TurboGrafx around 1990 in extremely limited quantities. \nAlthough there was no full-scale PAL region release of the system, imported PC \nEngine consoles were largely available in France and Benelux through major \nretailers thanks to the unlicensed importer Sodipeng (SociÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© de Distribution de \nla PC Engine, a subsidiary of Guillemot International).\n\nIn 2009, the TurboGrafx-16 was ranked as the 13th greatest video game console of \nall time by IGN.\n\n\n\nTurbo Engine is a PC Engine/Turbo Grafx 16, SuperGrafx and CDROM2 / Super CDROM2 \nemulator for Windows. Turbo Engine 16 was developed with an emphasis on \naccuracy. The system requirements for Turbo Engine 16 are a bit steeper than \nsome of the other emulators. The author recommends a minimum of a 2.2GHz Pentium \n4. Turbo Engine shares the same plugin system as the Genesis emulator Kega \nFusion so it can use any Kega Fusion compatible video plugins. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRun Turboengine.exe and pick a game from the roms folder","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b470dcf3ade687cec48c4878f1cba8661476faf","amp;dn":"TurboGrafx+Emulator-664+Roms+%5B-DEATH-RG-%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b470dcf3ade687cec48c4878f1cba8661476faf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,71,13,207,58,222,104,124,236,72,196,135,143,28,186,134,97,71,111,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
