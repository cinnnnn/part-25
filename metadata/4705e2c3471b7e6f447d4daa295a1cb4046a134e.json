But he always soared far beyond the dated categories of swing and be-bop in his lyricism, technical brilliance, soulfulness, and solid, down-home raunchy sweetness. Volume III is a 2 Disc Set, a (nearly) complete concert performed in Croydon, England at the acoustically admirable Fairfield Hall. Art was, at this time, almost continually touring with the first of his comeback bands, and this band was tight. They knew and understood the tunes and communicated as only true jazz people can in performance, like a team of rhythmic, lyric, limber psychics. All Art's bands had great moments. This is one of those moments with this magnificent band: Milcho Leviev on piano, Bob Magnusson on upright bass, Carl Burnett on drums. John S. Wilson praised this quartet in the New York Times, saying they made Art s innate rhythmic drive even more buoyant and referring to Bob Magnusson as fabulously fast-fingered. Critic Gary Giddins, in The Village Voice, said Bob Magnusson's sure time and rich tone in the bottom register complemented Pepper s frequently ethereal gambits and praised Carl Burnett s chatty responsiveness. Musician and critic Jon Hendricks called Milcho Leviev a most marvelous pianist, a real joy. He plays with beauty and passion. When I sent Milcho these discs, he listened and then called me up, exultant. &quot;We were so good!&quot; he said. &quot;We were so Good!&quot;\n\nTracklist\nDisc 1\n1. Blues for Blanche 12:41 \n2.
