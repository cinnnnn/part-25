RyuÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â   is a Japanese DJ and music composer for Konami's Beatmania series, along with creating individual releases as well as under the Exit Trance and beatnation labels. Some of his better known tracks are Starmine, Rainbow Rainbow, AGEHA, Mind Mapping, and the Caramelldansen and Caipirinha remixes.\n\nI, QMDMQ, am releasing this torrent since I am a fan of RyuÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â 's unique blend of happy hardcore, techno, and trance, and in trying to obtain every album of his, STAR RESONANT was exceptionally difficult to obtain. Hopefully putting this on Demonoid and ThePirateBay will enable more users to hear his style.\n\nAlbum Released: 03 April 2009\nTorrent Made: 22 March 2010\nAlbum Type: Doujin/Fanmade Digital Release\nAuthor: TheDeepStrikers\nGenre: Electronic/Happy Hardcore/J-Core/Techno/Trance\nCatalog #: TDS001-SR1ST~\n\nTracks are all 192kbps CBR LAME MP3s\n\nThere are five CDs in this release:\n1.
