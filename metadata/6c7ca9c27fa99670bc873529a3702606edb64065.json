(1988)\n\n\n\nBest known in the mainstream for her superb 1984 cover of Prince's &quot;I Feel for You,&quot; R&amp;B singer Chaka Khan enjoyed solo success as well as popularity as a member of the group Rufus. Born Yvette Marie Stevens in Great Lakes, IL, on March 23, 1953, she was raised on Chicago's South Side, and at the age of 11 formed her first group, the Crystalettes. While still in high school, she joined the Afro-Arts Theater, a group which toured with Motown great Mary Wells; a few years later, she adopted the African name Chaka Khan while working on the Black Panthers' breakfast program. After quitting high school in 1969, Khan joined the group Lyfe, soon exiting to join another dance band, the Babysitters; neither was on the fast track to success, but her fortunes changed when she teamed with ex-American Breed member Kevin Murphy and AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Fisher to form Rufus.\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nA first-class release, despite the fact that it didn't pack the normal commercial punch. But it had excellent production, many outstanding selections, and uniformly dazzling, booming, triumphant vocals from Khan. She currently speaks with disdain about the record business, and it's probably due to the relative failure of great records like this to break out and really enjoy the success they merit that's disillusioned her.\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)\n02.Soul Talkin'\n03.It's My Party\n04.Eternity\n05.Sticky Wicked\n06.The End Of A Love Affair\n07.Baby Me\n08.Make It Last\n09.Where Are You Tonite\n10.I'll Be Around\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n               ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c7ca9c27fa99670bc873529a3702606edb64065","amp;dn":"Chaka+Khan+-+C.K.+1988++CBR320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c7ca9c27fa99670bc873529a3702606edb64065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,124,169,194,127,169,150,112,188,135,53,41,163,112,38,6,237,182,64,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
