The inefficient and under manned police forces were losing in the long hard battle against crime. The city needed help, but the overburdened government could no longer cope with maintaining peace on the streets. The government proposed a bill giving individual corporations the right to form their own police/security forces and they in turn would provide protection for the companies and citizens of the cities. This bill was passed and a new order of law enforcement was birthed. Several well respected sec-forces were established and one hard hitting group calling themselves HARDCORPS helped lead the way in crime prevention and elimination. The chaos slowly subsides as the sec-forces bring peace and order back to the city. \n\nColonel John Blade, the owner of HARDCORPS, is currently trying to track down the source of a drug distributed on the streets called &quot;U4&quot;. This highly addictive drug has been around for some time, but lately strange things have been happening to its users. It is up to Blade to find out what is happening; figure out who or what is behind the weird problems now plaguing the streets; and put a stop to it.\n\nThis elaborate puzzle eventually leads back the mysterious Elexis Sinclair. A brilliant biochemist who is attempting to push the evolution of mankind ahead by a thousand generations and she will stop at nothing to get what she wants.\n\n\n\n\n\nWidescreen Guide!\n\n\nThe standard widescreen resolution in this port is 1920x1200.\n\nThe game only supports 4:3 resolutions from the ingame menu, so if you want to use your widescreen resolution you have to do the following:\n\n\nThe first thing you need to get is an Hex Editor.\nFor mac,  HexFiend is Great.\n\nRightclick on the Sin icon, click Show Package Content.\nNavigate to: Contents -&gt; Shared Support -&gt; CrossoverGames -&gt; Support -&gt; Default -&gt; Drive_c -&gt; Sin\nDrag the file &quot;Sin.exe&quot;, to your desktop.\n\n\n Open HexFiend, and locate the Sin.exe file on your desktop. Open it.\n\nStart by pressing &quot;CMD+F&quot;, to find a line. Mark the radiobutton ASCII.\nWrite:     1600\nAnd press Next.\n\n\nFind number 00800700, and 00B00400 (Usually next to eachother), to the left, from &quot;1600&quot; in the Hex part of the editor.\n\nThe part &quot;8007&quot;, and &quot;B004&quot;, and the ones that need to be changed.\n\n8007 is the screen width and B004 is the height.\nChange the two numbers (When you press delete, or backspace, it removes 2 digits. Remember that!!!) , into the resolution in the table below:\n\nFor example, if i want to change my resolution to 1280 x 720, \nill change 8007 to 0005, and B004 to D002\n\nAfter you have made your change, save the file, and drag it back into the Sin folder. Remember to make a backup of the original Sin.exe, if you mess something up.\n\n\nResolutions:\n\n_____________\n1650  x   1050\n90 06    1A 04\n_____________\n1440  x   900\nA0 05     84 03\n\n_____________\n1280   x   720\n00 05     D0 02\n\nNot every resolution work in full screen, but check it out.\nIf your resolution is not supported, use the original Sin.exe file, and play the game using a standard ingame resolution.\n\n\n\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:596c3831f85aae0716bac83b858eb18bbd82fd1e","amp;dn":"%5B++Sin++-++for+Mac++%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"596c3831f85aae0716bac83b858eb18bbd82fd1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,108,56,49,248,90,174,7,22,186,200,59,133,142,177,139,189,130,253,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
