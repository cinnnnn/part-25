NICU, Ya Mar, and Rocky Top were played in succession for the first time ever Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which would be quite an obscure item to report, except that all three songs found Trey exhorting Page to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Play it, Leo!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Trey subsequently announced the songs as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leo Trio.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ya Mar also included a lyrical change to reference MikeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Segway. Piper contained a tease of Tweezer Reprise. Rock and Roll and Seven Below were unfinished. YEM included a CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Stand the Weather tease.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75cefab036b1b149243ac5820189a9913be3e41e","amp;dn":"Phish+-+2003-07-19+-+Alpine+Valley+Music+Theatre+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75cefab036b1b149243ac5820189a9913be3e41e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,206,250,176,54,177,177,73,36,58,197,130,1,137,169,145,59,227,228,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
