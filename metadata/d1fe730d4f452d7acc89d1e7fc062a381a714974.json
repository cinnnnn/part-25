Her beloved cat Mr Grey's been put to sleep, and her new room-mate, Tim, is a jerk. Walking home, she sees a cat the spitting image of Mr Grey, and hears a voice say, I wouldnt go in just now. She enters to find Tim dead stabbed with her own knife. Dulcie's in the frame for murder and she hasn't seen the last of Mr Grey, either . . \n\nGrey Matters:\nDulcie Schwartz and her feline friends get tangled up in this mysterious yarn . . . - Caught between a distracted supervisor and university politics, DulcieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doctoral thesis looks doomed. When she stumbles across the bloodied body of a fellow student, things couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get any worse. Unless her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreams turn out to be premonitions and DulcieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work has all been in vain . . . With the ghost of Mr Grey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ her wise and loyal late, great cat Ã¢â‚¬â€œ strangely silent, and her new kitten refusing to speak, this time Dulcie might just be on her own.\n\nGrey Zone \nWhen a student goes missing and a professor ends up dead, Dulcie Schwartz realizes that midterms are going to be worse than ever. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard at work on her thesis, but present day concerns Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including the destructive mischief of her growing kitten Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keep dragging her back into a tangle of motive, misbehavior, and maybe even murder. If only Mr Grey, her beloved feline ghost, would lend a hand, at least with that rambunctious kitten . . .\n\nGrey Expectations\nCould a missing book be haunted? Dulcie Schwartz doesn't want to think so, but ever since it disappeared from the university, things have gone from bad to worse - one of her colleagues accused of homicide, and another revealed as an impostor. To top it all off, both the ghost cat Mr Grey and the kitten Esme seem to have switched their allegiance to her boyfriend. Deprived of feline assistance, Dulcie must uncover the truth by herself, or else find herself on the hook for the theft - and murder.\n\nTrue Grey\nThings look bleak for cat-loving Dulcie Schwartz when she finds the body of an academic rival she threatened to kill just days before . . . When Dulcie Schwartz stumbles across the body of Melinda Sloane Harquist, a visiting scholar whose upcoming book threatens to ruin DulcieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thesis and who she threatened to kill, in jest, just days before, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creepily reminiscent of the nightmares that have been waking her for the past week. And with boyfriend Chris distant and preoccupied, and both the ghost cat Mr Grey and her kitten EsmÃƒÂ© strangely cryptic in their advice, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Dulcie to prove herself innocent, before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late . . .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1fe730d4f452d7acc89d1e7fc062a381a714974","amp;dn":"Dulcie+Schwartz+Mystery+Series+-+Clea+Simon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1fe730d4f452d7acc89d1e7fc062a381a714974","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,254,115,13,79,69,45,122,204,137,209,231,252,6,42,56,26,113,73,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
