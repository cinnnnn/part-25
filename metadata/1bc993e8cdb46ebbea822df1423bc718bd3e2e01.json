The tale of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and the fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker has become modern myth, an epic tragedy of the corruption of a young man in love into darkness, the rise of evil, and the power of good triumphing in the end.\n\nBut it didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t start out that way.\n\nIn this thorough account of one of cinemaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most lasting works, Michael Kaminski presents the true history of how Star Wars was written, from its beginnings as a science fiction fairy tale to its development over three decades into the epic we now know, chronicling the methods, techniques, thought processes, and struggles of its creator.  For this unauthorized account, he has pored through over four hundred sources, from interviews to original scripts, to track how the most powerful modern epic in the world was created, expanded, and finalized into the tale an entire generation has grown up with.\n\nNow available from Barnes &amp; Noble; on Amazon in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Japan; and your local bookstore.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bc993e8cdb46ebbea822df1423bc718bd3e2e01","amp;dn":"The+Secret+History+of+Star+Wars-+Ebook-+Sample","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bc993e8cdb46ebbea822df1423bc718bd3e2e01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,201,147,232,205,180,110,187,234,130,45,241,66,59,199,24,189,62,46,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
