Extract from DSO citation Clive Caldwell was officially attributed with 27 victories and became Australia's highest scoring fighter pilot in World War II. In addition, he became an ace in both the Middle East and Pacific theatres - the only Australian pilot to attain this status. Kristen Alexander has had unrivalled access to Caldwell's personal papers as well as official and privately held records. She vividly brings to life Caldwell's aerial exploits and presents a man driven to carry out his duty. Originally considered an individualist, Caldwell became a fine fighter pilot and a dedicated leader, much loved by those he commanded. But he did not wear the restrictions of the RAAF well and, despite his achievements, endured public inquiry over liquor trading and the so-called 'Morotai Mutiny'. Even so, he continued to be well-regarded and respected by the public.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8f2ddb912727aee2f72211abd8ba67a3c614779","amp;dn":"Clive+Caldwell%2C+Air+Ace+-+Kristen+Alexander.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8f2ddb912727aee2f72211abd8ba67a3c614779","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,242,221,185,18,114,122,238,47,114,33,26,189,139,166,122,60,97,71,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
