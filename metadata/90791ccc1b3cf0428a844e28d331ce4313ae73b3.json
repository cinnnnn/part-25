Yet African art, perhaps more than any other, is widely misunderstood. Far from being &quot;primitive,&quot; it represents a highly developed aesthetic expressed by accomplished professional artists who have complete mastery over their materials and techniques.\r\n\r\nThe study of African art is in its infancy, and Westerners are only beginning to learn the complex system of symbols embodied in the carved, cast, and painted objects that altered the course of modern art early in this century. Most African art is functional, with decoration that is often secondary. Many objects are made to express and support fundamental spiritual values essential to the survival of the community. Much African art serves a directly religious functionâ€”as tribute to a spirit or as a diviner's aid. Some objects insure fertility, not only in humans, but in crops, game, and livestock as well. Cultural traditions are transmitted across the generations through works of art used in rites of initiation. Other art is political in function; images of kings proclaim their wealth and power; the possession of a crown, for example, can prove the legitimacy of a leader's succession. The arts also serve politics in the objects created for use by the men's societies that govern many villages.\r\n\r\nThe 150 objects discussed and illustrated here are from the collection of Paul and Ruth Tishman, whose interest in African art began more than twenty years ago. Since then, the Tishmans have constantly refined their collection, which now contains the full range of African sculptures, from delicate sixteenth-century Sherbro-Portuguese ivories to boldly conceived wooden figures from Cameroon (front cover)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90791ccc1b3cf0428a844e28d331ce4313ae73b3","amp;dn":"For+Spirits+and+Kings+-+African+Art+from+the+Tishman+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90791ccc1b3cf0428a844e28d331ce4313ae73b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,121,28,204,27,60,240,66,138,132,78,40,211,49,206,67,19,174,115,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
