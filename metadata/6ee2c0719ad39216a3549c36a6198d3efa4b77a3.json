According to Andersen, this approach to creating new managers is epidemic. Using an accessible gardening metaphor, Andersen, founder of Proteus International, contends that new managers must have a support system available to train them, while on the job, to become successful managers.\n\nAbout the author:\nErika Andersen has developed a reputation for creating learning and change processes and programs uniquely tailored to her clients? challenges, goals, and culture. She and her colleagues at Proteus International, the company she founded in 1990, offer practical methods and skills for individuals, teams, and organizations to clarify and move toward their hoped-for-future. Much of Erika?s recent work has focused on organizational visioning and strategy, executive coaching, and management and leadership development. She has served as consultant and advisor to the CEOs and top executives of corporations like MTV Networks, Molson Coors Brewing, Rainbow Media Holdings, Union Square Hospitality Group, and Comcast Corporation. She has been invited to share her insights about managing people and creating successful organizations by speaking before corporate and non-profit groups and national associations. Her work has been translated into Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish, German and French, and she has been quoted in a variety of national publications, including the New York Times, Industry Week, Investors? Business daily, and Fortune. Her book, Growing Great Employees, is published by Penguin Portfolio.\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____| ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ee2c0719ad39216a3549c36a6198d3efa4b77a3","amp;dn":"%28PDF%29Manifesto.Growing.Great.New.Managers-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ee2c0719ad39216a3549c36a6198d3efa4b77a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,226,192,113,154,211,146,22,163,84,156,54,166,25,141,62,250,75,119,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
