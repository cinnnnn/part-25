The albums Overkill, its follow on, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep &amp;#039;til Hammersmith, cemented MotÃƒÂ¶rhead&amp;#039;s reputation as one of Britain&amp;#039;s foremost heavy metal groups.[1] More recent exposure has included providing wrestler Triple H&amp;#039;s entrance music, and performing live at WrestleMania events; and in 2004, contributing the song, &quot;You Better Swim&quot;, to the soundtrack of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. In 2005 the band received their first Grammy.\n\nWhile the band are typically classified as heavy metal or speed metal, Kilmister, just like AC/DC&amp;#039;s Angus and Malcolm Young, dislikes the label, preferring to describe MotÃƒÂ¶rhead&amp;#039;s style simply as &quot;rock and roll&quot;.[2] MotÃƒÂ¶rhead&amp;#039;s lyrics cover such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and &quot;life on the road&quot; ? the latter is portrayed in songs like &quot;(We Are) The Road Crew&quot;, &quot;Iron Horse/Born to Lose&quot;, and &quot;Keep Us on the Road&quot;.\n\n\n\n- List of free, complete Motorhead albums waiting at www.FreeForPunks.com -\nMotorhead - 1916\nMotorhead - Ace of Spades\nMotorhead - Another Perfect Day\nMotorhead - Bastards\nMotorhead - BBC Live &amp; in session\nMotorhead - Bomber (Remastered)\nMotorhead - Everything Louder Than Everything Else\nMotorhead - Hammered\nMotorhead - Hellraiser Best of the Epic Years\nMotorhead - Inferno\nMotorhead - Iron Fist (Full Length)\nMotorhead - Iron Fist (EP)\nMotorhead - Keep Us on the Road-Live 1977\nMotorhead - King Biscuit Flower Hour\nMotorhead - Kiss of Death\nMotorhead - Live at Brixton 87\nMotorhead - Live at Brixton Academy [UK]\nMotorhead - March Ãƒâ€“r Die\nMotorhead - Meltdown\nMotorhead - Motorhead\nMotorhead - No Remorse\nMotorhead - No Sleep at all\nMotorhead - No Sleep &amp;#039;til Hammersmith\nMotorhead - On Parole\nMotorhead - Orgasmatron\nMotorhead - Overkill\nMotorhead - Overnight Sensation\nMotorhead - Rock &amp;#039; N&amp;#039; Roll\nMotorhead - Sacrifice\nMotorhead - Snake Bite Love\nMotorhead - Stage Fright\nMotorhead - Stone Deaf Forever\nMotorhead - Tear Ya Down - The Rarities\nMotorhead - The Birthday Party\nMotorhead - The Golden Years\nMotorhead - We Are Motorhead\nMotorhead - What&amp;#039;s Words Worth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dfbba3f01e42ad44e214279c3c0e4a233e184c7","amp;dn":"Motorhead+-+Ace+of+Spades","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dfbba3f01e42ad44e214279c3c0e4a233e184c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,251,186,63,1,228,42,212,78,33,66,121,195,192,228,162,51,225,132,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
