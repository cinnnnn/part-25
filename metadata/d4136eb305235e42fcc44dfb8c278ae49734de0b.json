Joined by the trumpeter and cornetist Don Cherry, the saxophonist John Tchicai, and the trombonist Roswell Rudd, as well as by Peacock and Murray, Ayler guides the group through the powerful authority of his playing; the riotous revelry joins the joy of New Orleans traditions to the urbane furies of the day. ~ Richard Brody, The New Yorker\n\nThe Music:\n01 - Don's Dawn 01:03\n02 - A Y 21:21\n03 - ITT 23:23\n\nThe Players:\n* Albert Ayler Ã¢â‚¬â€ Sax (Tenor)\n* John Tchicai Ã¢â‚¬â€ Sax (Alto)\n* Don Cherry Ã¢â‚¬â€ Trumpet, Cornet\n* Roswell Rudd Ã¢â‚¬â€ Trombone\n* Gary Peacock Ã¢â‚¬â€ Bass\n* Sunny Murray Ã¢â‚¬â€ Drums\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4136eb305235e42fcc44dfb8c278ae49734de0b","amp;dn":"Albert+Ayler+-+New+York+Eye+And+Ear+Control","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4136eb305235e42fcc44dfb8c278ae49734de0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,19,110,179,5,35,94,66,252,196,77,251,140,39,138,228,151,52,222,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
