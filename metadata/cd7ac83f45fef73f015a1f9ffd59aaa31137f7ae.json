During its heyday from 1972 -\n1978, the group was influential for helping lead the movement towards free jazz\non the New York City loft scene, especially RiversÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ own Studio Rivbea. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nhard to believe that the three musicians had not played together for twenty\nfive years before this concert, because they seemingly picked right up where\nthey left off. Rivers was a remarkable multi-instrumentalist, playing tenor and\nsoprano saxophone, piano and flute and switching between instruments with\nremarkable clarity and agility. Instead of the scalding energy music that is\nassociated with much free playing, the music presented here by the trio is high\nenergy, but the freedom is a freedom of ideas, of moving across space and time\nas they choose in the course of two lengthy uninterrupted sets. Holland is\nremarkable as always, playing a deep toned and rock solid bass that flows\nbeautifully and Altschul sounds similarly inspired developing deep swirls of\npercussive sounds, interacting beautifully with Holland and Rivers. There are a\nfew solo and trio settings over the course of the two sets, but the focus of\nthe music is the deeply empathetic collective improvisation. The band is\ntotally focused in the moment, like artists walking up to a blank canvas and\nextemporaneously creating in real time with no preconceived notions. It almost\nhas the feel of listening to an intimate conversation between longtime friends,\nand that conversation is thrilling.\n\n--\n\nBy Paul Acquaro &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2013/02/weekend-roundup-fractures-fragments.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2013/02/weekend-roundup-fractures-fragments.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Marc Medwin &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/7376&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/7376&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Mark Corroto &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=42952&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=42952&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMaciej KarÃ…â€šowski (pl) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://jazzarium.pl/przeczytaj/recenzje/reunion-live-new-york-0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://jazzarium.pl/przeczytaj/recenzje/reunion-live-new-york-0&lt;/a&gt;\n\nElfio Nicolosi (it)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd7ac83f45fef73f015a1f9ffd59aaa31137f7ae","amp;dn":"Sam+Rivers%2C+Dave+Holland%2C+Barry+Altschul+-+Reunion%3A+Live+in+New+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd7ac83f45fef73f015a1f9ffd59aaa31137f7ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,122,200,63,69,254,247,63,1,90,31,159,253,89,170,163,17,55,247,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
