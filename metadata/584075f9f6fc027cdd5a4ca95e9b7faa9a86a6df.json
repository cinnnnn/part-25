They were promised a comfortable and peaceful life in the &quot;Reich home for the aged&quot; and were hoodwinked into signing over to the S.S. all of their properties and assets. In reality, many would be sent on to death camps such as Auschwitz.\n\nFrom 1943, following international concern, the Nazis developed Theresienstadt into a &quot;show camp&quot; a propaganda exercise designed to conceal from the outside world what was really happening to EuropeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s Jews. A large scale &quot;beautification&quot; programme swung into action, giving the camp a pleasant and respectable facade, a deception that succeeded in shielding  the terrible truth.\n\nScene selection\n1.\tDeception and reality\n2.\tThe 2nd deception\n3.\tContrast to reality\n4.\tProduction huts\n5.\tThe first film\n6.\tDaily struggle\n7.\tBeautification\n8.\tAuschwitz\n9.\tA picture of health\n10.\tThe football match\n11.\tFinal deception\n\nSpecial features\nInteractive menus\n11 scene selections\nTest your knowledge\nExcerpts from other titles in the series\n\nMain future length 72 min approx\n\nDVD 5\nPAL\nEnglish (no subs)\n4:3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:584075f9f6fc027cdd5a4ca95e9b7faa9a86a6df","amp;dn":"The+holocaust+Ghetto+Theresienstadt+The+truht+behind+the+Nazi+de","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"584075f9f6fc027cdd5a4ca95e9b7faa9a86a6df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,64,117,249,246,252,2,124,221,90,76,169,94,155,127,170,154,134,166,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
