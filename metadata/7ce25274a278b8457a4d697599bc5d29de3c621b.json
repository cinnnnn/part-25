This means the game will be improved on a regular basis, so be sure to check back for new updates. \n Right now, KSP is in Alpha state, but we want you to try it out and have fun with it. The first versions are free to download and play, and will remain so forever.\n\nFor the last year, we've been working very hard on KSP. This project is much more than a job for us, we really love it, and we put our best efforts into it. We're all bursting with happiness at the incredible reception the game has had. But now, we need your help to continue developing KSP, so it can become all that we expect it to be. We are completely commited to the project, and we are and always will be listening to your opinions and suggestions. We love the KSP community, and we want to give you all a fantastic game. So, we've opened the Pre-Order/Donations system to allow everyone to contribute to the project.\n\nYou can donate any amount you want and you have the opportunity to pre-order KSP for a discounted price of $7.00 USD. This offer will only be available for a limited time, so if you believe in the project and want to see KSP become the game we all want, your support will be immensely appreciated. By pre-ordering KSP now, you get the game in it's current state, and all future updates. \n\nKSP will remain free to download for the next few months though, and continue to be freely updated during that time. Later, the latest version of the game will only be available through purchase, but we'll leave the last free version open forever as a demo.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/kspstore/index.php?c=20&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/kspstore/index.php?c=20&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ce25274a278b8457a4d697599bc5d29de3c621b","amp;dn":"Kerbal+Space+Program+13.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ce25274a278b8457a4d697599bc5d29de3c621b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,226,82,116,162,120,184,69,122,77,105,117,153,188,93,41,222,60,98,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
