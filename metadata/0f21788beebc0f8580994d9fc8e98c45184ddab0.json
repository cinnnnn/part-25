He toured with the Rolling Stones and had an international hit with a duet with Mick Jagger, then toured again to equally rapturous world audiences as the headlining act. His words would cause an uproar at the One Peace concert, but then unlike fellow Wailer Bob Marley, Tosh always made his true feelings known. He was born Winston Hubert McIntosh on October 19, 1944, in the small rural village of Grange Hill, Jamaica. Like so many young island teens searching for a better life, he left home at 15 and headed for Kingston. Once there, he made his way to Joe Higgs' tenement yard, joining other aspiring youths eager for the vocal coaching lessons the singing star provided to local teens. Amongst these youthful wannabes were Bunny, Bob Marley, and the much younger Junior Braithwaite; the four, buttressed by backing vocalists Cherry Green and Beverley Kelso, joined forces initially as the Teenagers before eventually settling on the moniker the Wailers.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tReggae\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Steppin' Razor\n02.Igziabeher (Let Jah Be Praised)\n03.African\n04.Legalize It\n05.Why Must I Cry\n06.Equal Rights\n07.400 Years (Live)\n08.Burial\n09.Get Up, Stand Up\n10.Ketchy Shuby\n11.Downpressor Man\n12.Brand New Second Hand\n13.Watcha Gonna Do (Live)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f21788beebc0f8580994d9fc8e98c45184ddab0","amp;dn":"Peter+Tosh+-+The+Essential+%5BColumbia+%5D+%282003%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f21788beebc0f8580994d9fc8e98c45184ddab0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,33,120,139,238,188,15,133,128,153,77,159,200,233,140,69,24,77,218,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
