He also wrote a great deal of chamber and sacred music. Rubbra's works went into eclipse in the 60s and 70s, as the BBC management pushed British serialists to garner musical attention abroad, but he lived long enough to see the critical tide reverse itself, and respect return for at least some of his life's work.\r\n\r\nHis Seventh Symphony is considered one of his best by critics. Its finale, a passacaglia, has been numbered among the best symphonic movements of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nTwo bios enclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can find my classical uploads by searching on Philidor, or checking this thread:\r\n \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Philidor-s-uploads--63895","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6600621e9f3b045b2ab03d1201915f18b9ee2e5c","amp;dn":"Rubbra+-+Sym+%237+-+R+Hickox%2C+BBC+Nat+O+of+Wales+%281999%29+%5BPhilidor%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6600621e9f3b045b2ab03d1201915f18b9ee2e5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,0,98,30,159,59,4,91,42,176,61,18,1,145,95,24,185,238,46,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
