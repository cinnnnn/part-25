Based on the popular television documentary series, The Day the Universe Changed is a bestselling history that challenges the reader to decide whether there is absolute knowledge to discover - or whether the universe is &quot;ultimately what we say it is&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e25be18afa1f9cb33b74000e37f75e64d5a67be","amp;dn":"James+Burke+-+The+Day+the+Universe+Changed+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e25be18afa1f9cb33b74000e37f75e64d5a67be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,37,190,24,175,161,249,203,51,183,64,0,227,127,117,230,77,90,103,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
