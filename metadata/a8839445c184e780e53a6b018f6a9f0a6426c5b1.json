Coverage was in-depth with much technical detail, rather than user-oriented. Print publication ceased in 1998 and online publication in 2013.\r\n\r\nByte started in 1975, shortly after the first personal computers appeared as kits advertised in the back of electronics magazines. Byte was published monthly, with an initial yearly subscription price of $10.&quot;&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nThis set of BYTE Magazine is not 100% complete.
