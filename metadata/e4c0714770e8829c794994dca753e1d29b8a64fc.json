The notes (scans are included) accompanying the disc lay out the theory by which this music was produced. Suzanne Haik-Vantoura's work was to decipher the markings around the words in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible as if they were musical notations.  This is pretty far out. Perhaps even farther out is the notion that these markings represent the actual music sung at the temple in Jerusalem prior to 70 CE. This theory, however, overlooks one very important fact. The oldest Hebrew Biblical texts we have, from Qumran, written while the temple was operating, and for a little while after, possess neither vowel markings nor what are now generally considered cantillation marks. These marks appear, along with the vowel marks, only in Medieval manuscripts. \n\nEarly Medieval Christian music was signified in a similar manner, with markings above the Latin text, which are now poorly understood. A Benedictine music professor suggested that these were memnonic devices as part of an essentially oral transmission process. It seems more likely than not, that the marking of the Masoretic text were part of a similar development, and not inherent in the original composition of the text. Whatever the truth is, however, these tracks are very interesting. Many of the chants are unaccompanied, some utilize a spare harmonic choir and instrumentation. \n\nTracks:\n\n Psaume 23 &quot;L'Eternel est mon berger&quot; \nComposed by Jewish Traditional \nwith Pierre Pollin, Adolphe Attia, Michel Scherb, Emile Kacmann, Martine Geliot, Raymond Couste, Gerard Perrotin \n\n\n BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©diction sacerdotale (Nombres 6, 22) \nComposed by Jewish Traditional \nwith Pierre Pollin, Adolphe Attia, Michel Scherb, Emile Kacmann, Martine Geliot, Raymond Couste, Gerard Perrotin \n\n\n Psaume 24 &quot;A l'Eternel appartient la terre&quot; \nComposed by Jewish Traditional \nwith Pierre Pollin, Adolphe Attia, Michel Scherb, Emile Kacmann, Martine Geliot, Raymond Couste, Gerard Perrotin \n\n\n Cantique des Cantiques (1,1) \nComposed by Jewish Traditional \nwith Pierre Pollin, Adolphe Attia, Michel Scherb, Emile Kacmann, Martine Geliot, Raymond Couste, Gerard Perrotin \n\n\n Pasume 6 \nComposed by Jewish Traditional \nwith Pierre Pollin, Adolphe Attia, Michel Scherb, Emile Kacmann, Martine Geliot, Raymond Couste, Gerard Perrotin \n\n\n Lamentations (1, 1) \nComposed by Jewish Traditional \nwith Pierre Pollin, Adolphe Attia, Michel Scherb, Emile Kacmann, Martine Geliot, Raymond Couste, Gerard Perrotin \n\n\n Psaume 133 \nComposed by Jewish Traditional \nwith Pierre Pollin, Adolphe Attia, Michel Scherb, Emile Kacmann, Martine Geliot, Raymond Couste, Gerard Perrotin \n\n\n Ecoute, IsraÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«l (DeutÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ronome 6, 4) \nComposed by Jewish Traditional \nwith Pierre Pollin, Adolphe Attia, Michel Scherb, Emile Kacmann, Martine Geliot, Raymond Couste, Gerard Perrotin \n\n\n Psaume 150 &quot;AllÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©luia!&quot; \nComposed by Jewish Traditional \nwith Pierre Pollin, Adolphe Attia, Michel Scherb, Emile Kacmann, Martine Geliot, Raymond Couste, Gerard Perrotin \n\n\n ElÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gie de David (2 Samuel 1, 19) \nComposed by Jewish Traditional \nwith Pierre Pollin, Adolphe Attia, Michel Scherb, Emile Kacmann, Martine Geliot, Raymond Couste, Gerard Perrotin \n\n\n Psaume 122 &quot;Je suis joyeux lorsqu'on me dit...&quot; \nComposed by Jewish Traditional \nwith Pierre Pollin, Adolphe Attia, Michel Scherb, Emile Kacmann, Martine Geliot, Raymond Couste, Gerard Perrotin \n\n\n Psaume 123 &quot;Ver toi j'ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ve mes regards...&quot; \nComposed by Jewish Traditional \nwith Pierre Pollin, Adolphe Attia, Michel Scherb, Emile Kacmann, Martine Geliot, Raymond Couste, Gerard Perrotin \n\n\n Esther (5, 1) \nComposed by Jewish Traditional \nwith Pierre Pollin, Adolphe Attia, Michel Scherb, Emile Kacmann, Martine Geliot, Raymond Couste, Gerard Perrotin \n\n\n Le buisson ardent (Exode 3, 1) \nComposed by Jewish Traditional \nwith Pierre Pollin, Adolphe Attia, Michel Scherb, Emile Kacmann, Martine Geliot, Raymond Couste, Gerard Perrotin \n\nTake what you want, enjoy what you take, and please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4c0714770e8829c794994dca753e1d29b8a64fc","amp;dn":"Music+of+the+Bible+Revealed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4c0714770e8829c794994dca753e1d29b8a64fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,192,113,71,112,232,130,156,121,73,148,220,167,83,225,210,155,138,100,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
