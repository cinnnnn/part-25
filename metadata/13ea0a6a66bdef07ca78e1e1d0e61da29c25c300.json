It contains a full recording of Zappa's September 19, 1985 testimony before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, during which he criticized the Parents Music Resource Center in support of the recording industry. The album's release commemorates the 25th anniversary of the hearings.\nIn a press release, Gail Zappa said of the album,\n&quot;'Congress Shall Make No Law...' is released as an educational project, representing Zappa's tireless commitment to the First Amendment which he felt his duty to protect by providing (in his words) &quot;stimulating digital audio entertainment&quot; in the form of &quot;material which a truly free society would neither fear nor suppress.&quot;[2]\nCongress Shall Make No Law... also includes Zappa testimony before the Maryland State Legislature the following year, as well as various quotes and interview excerpts on the subject of censorship and an alternate version of the song Reagan at Bitburg, one of the last pieces Zappa finished before his death in 1993. The first official version of the track was included on the 1994 album, Civilization Phaze III.[3] Many of the tracks are named after the Ten Commandments, each corresponding to the particular topic of Zappa's opinion.
