Crichton (Wiley, 2001).pdf\r\n\r\nIron is of fundamental importance for the growth, development and well being of almost all living organisms. Multiple biological systems have been developed for the uptake, utilisation, storage and homeostasis of iron in microbes, plants and mammals. e.g. Both iron deficiency and iron overload are found extensively in man: the intimate links between iron and oxidative stress are associated with a wide range of pathologies; iron has a well established role in infections by a wide range of microorganisms and parasites; there is a close link between iron requirements and cellular division with implications for cancers and other metals such as copper and zinc are closely linked with iron metabolism.\r\nThe first edition of this book was published in 1991. Since then the extensive impact of molecular cell biology on the field of iron biochemistry has opened new horizons in our understanding of the transport and storage of iron and of its homeostasis. The explosive use of molecular biological techniques applied to cellular biology of iron metabolism has resulted in a rapid expansion in the literature which has led to the need for this second edition.\r\n\r\nThis second edition also:\r\n\r\nIntroduces many illustrations and colour photos to make the basic concepts far clearer\r\nIncludes new chapters on iron and cell division and interactions of iron with other metals - particularly copper and zinc\r\nProvides additional anecdotes\r\nIncorporates an extensive and up-to-date bibliography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bcac2b9efdbd67e6d31d4cdd21734ae4df29a20","amp;dn":"Inorganic+Biochemistry+of+Iron+Metabolism+2nd+ed+-+R.+Crichton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bcac2b9efdbd67e6d31d4cdd21734ae4df29a20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,202,194,185,239,219,214,126,109,49,212,205,210,23,52,174,77,242,154,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
