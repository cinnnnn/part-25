I came across it looking for issues of 'The Marquis', by Guy Davis, and since I didn't see it here at TPB I thought I'd go ahead and share it. It seems to be set sometime in the late 1700s or early 1800s and the art is quite good. A couple of issues deal with clipper ships and sea travel and it seems, in general, to be about one man who does a good deal of getting around (I'm guessing he's the Marquis of Anaon).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:796faaadc345287989729a8314f34fe388456dcb","amp;dn":"The+Marquis+of+Anaon+%28Scanlation%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"796faaadc345287989729a8314f34fe388456dcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,111,170,173,195,69,40,121,137,114,154,131,20,243,79,227,136,69,109,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
