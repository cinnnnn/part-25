After the war, the devils' power was banned and the world was restored to peace. Cecily Campbell is a knight, who has been looking for a blacksmith to repair her old sword given by her father. One day, she saw a man fighting with a ruffian who used the tabooed devil's power. The man defeated him with one blow of his weirdly shaped sword. The man turned out to be a blacksmith called Luke. The fateful encounter was the beginning of the adventure.\n\nEpisodes: 1 - 12\nSubs: Seto_Otaku\nCodec: 8bit H.264 1080p\nAudio: 2-Channel AAC\n\n\nFiles in torrent:\n\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 01 [BD][1080p][AAC].mp4\t654.1 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 02 [BD][1080p][AAC].mp4\t494.5 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 03 [BD][1080p][AAC].mp4\t511.3 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 04 [BD][1080p][AAC].mp4\t678.7 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 05 [BD][1080p][AAC].mp4\t469.9 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 06 [BD][1080p][AAC].mp4\t594.5 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 07 [BD][1080p][AAC].mp4\t454.1 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 08 [BD][1080p][AAC].mp4\t545.5 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 09 [BD][1080p][AAC].mp4\t546.7 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 10 [BD][1080p][AAC].mp4\t524.4 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 11 [BD][1080p][AAC].mp4\t472.1 MiB\n[DeadFish] Seiken no Blacksmith - 12 [BD][1080p][AAC].mp4\t568.4 MiB\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a666688169f341f6d442c45bc343eb1a89335593","amp;dn":"%5BDeadFish%5D+Seiken+no+Blacksmith+-+1-12+Complete+%5BBD%5D%5B1080p%5D%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a666688169f341f6d442c45bc343eb1a89335593","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,102,104,129,105,243,65,246,212,66,196,91,195,67,235,26,137,51,85,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
