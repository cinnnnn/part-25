In between video-games and milk cups, pain and disappointment, they need to learn how to live together. \n\n\n\nAn excellent short film (18 minutes). It captures the characters, the setting, a major transition in their lives, and will leave you emotionally invested and affected. If you know someone who thinks short films are a waste of time, point them toward this.\n\nWithout going into specifics, the film deals with a twenty-something gay couple on the brink of a new phase in their relationship as they try to deal with a number of changes in their lives. Also featuring is the ten-year-old brother of one of them, who comes to play an integral part in the story.\n\nThe short film premiered at the 2008 Berlin International Film Festival and went on to win the festivals' Crystal Bear prize for Best Short Film.\n\n10 January 2011 | by whitten-1 (United Kingdom)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab74d06c3a4c0bbb60e3657f1c7655099668ecfd","amp;dn":"Cafe+Com+Leite+%282007%29+%28Short%29+Gay+Interest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab74d06c3a4c0bbb60e3657f1c7655099668ecfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,116,208,108,58,76,11,187,96,227,101,127,28,118,85,9,150,104,236,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
