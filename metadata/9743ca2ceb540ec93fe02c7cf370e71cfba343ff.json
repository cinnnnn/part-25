The kind of people who are immersed in its wonder, obsessed by the never ending panoply of electric noise.Whyte Horses are an enigmatic group from Manchester who make guitars chime like lysergic bells and sing songs so full of wonder that they make your heart ache. They shape-shift from Turkish psyche to Brazilian trip music, from acid house to electronica to punk rock to guitar classic in a heartbeat. It really shouldn't work, but it's synthesized that it absolutely does. There is a hypnotic beauty to their music and a poetic perfection to their muse. The band is the brainchild of Dom Thomas, a music fanatic and chronologist who scours the planet for obscure and rare vinyl genius. This obsession is in their musical DNA and Whyte Horses are the sound of people who, on the quest for the perfect record, decided to make one themselves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9743ca2ceb540ec93fe02c7cf370e71cfba343ff","amp;dn":"Whyte+Horses+-+Pop+or+Not+%282015%29+%5B16.44+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9743ca2ceb540ec93fe02c7cf370e71cfba343ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,67,202,44,235,84,14,201,63,224,44,124,243,112,231,28,251,163,67,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
