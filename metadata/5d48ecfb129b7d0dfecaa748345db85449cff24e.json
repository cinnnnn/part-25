The authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thoughts and words anticipate the appearance of visual images crystallised from flickering impressions of reality, composed in a manner that is eloquent yet austere, fantastic yet truthful.\nIn this voyage the names of people and places are alienated: this unfettered dream, a dream about the infinitude of space and time, needs no frontiers or passports.\nImages of the native land: an altar in a church where a baby is being baptised, surrounded by sombre faces, the familiar landscapes of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œabandoned homelandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the frontier zone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are succeeded by other images: by the glittering lights of a western town at night, by the portrait of a young man, speaking a foreign language and retaining his smile even at a sad recollection.\nNeither these landscapes nor these portraits convey distinctive marks of today's life, but rather the unchanging generic features of various sources of human existence. Only the director's will leads us to the point of convergence. When, following him through deserted rooms of a museum at night, in old 16th century Dutch paintings we discern and recognise the elusive warmth of life and our eternal yearning for a voyage ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ so that we may return ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to one another. For art alone can give us the unique chance to take part in this cycle.\nAlexandra Tuchinskaya English translation by Anna Shoulgat and Nora Hoppe\n\nEnglish, spanish, italian, french and portuguese subtitles\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nFile Name .........................................: Elegiya dorogi.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 656,631,808 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 00:47:20\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x464 (AR: 1.379)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1651 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.232 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1 \n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
