He has recently retired from a lifetime of proofreading telephone directories. His favourite haunt in Hillbrow, the CafÃƒÂ© Europa, is about to close its doors; the familiar old South Africa is already gone. Standards, he grumbles, are in decline, so bad-tempered, conservative Tearle embarks on a grandiose plan to enlighten his fellow citizens.
