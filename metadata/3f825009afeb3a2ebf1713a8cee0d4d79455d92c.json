The band's music is a fusion of many different styles, including industrial, techno, ambient, experimental, funk and country music. The band name is a reference to &quot;kissing and cuddling,&quot; and Thrussell has stated that the name symbolizes the Marxist concept of destroying barriers between people. Thrussell's songs frequently contain themes of anti-capitalism, anti-fascism, anti-consumerism, individuality and anti-big-brotherism.\n\nMore flacced Snog albums to follow!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f825009afeb3a2ebf1713a8cee0d4d79455d92c","amp;dn":"Snog+-+Dear+Valued+Customer+1994+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f825009afeb3a2ebf1713a8cee0d4d79455d92c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,130,80,9,175,235,58,46,191,23,19,168,206,224,212,215,148,85,217,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
