Brent Strong (Pearson Prentice Hall, 2006).pdf\n\nFor courses in Plastics, Materials and Manufacturing found in departments of mechanical, industrial or manufacturing technology or engineering; also for any beginning course in Plastics in engineering or technology programs. This book is designed to introduce plastics to a wide range of students who need to either gain, improve, or refresh their knowledge of plastic materials and manufacturing. It fully discusses both materials and manufacturing processes in a carefully-constructed and logical presentation. While providing a fundamental overview of a broad spectrum of topics, the text's high level of detail makes it valuable as both an introductory text and, later, a professional reference manual","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e69adc144ccb62f5c68cf8d572d7b5a6a2c343a","amp;dn":"Plastics+-+Materials+and+Processing+-+A.+Brent+Strong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e69adc144ccb62f5c68cf8d572d7b5a6a2c343a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,105,173,193,68,204,182,47,92,104,207,141,87,45,123,90,106,44,52,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
