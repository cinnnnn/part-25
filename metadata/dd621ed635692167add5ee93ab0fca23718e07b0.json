However, Carroll was also a poet who wove dark visions and supernatural themes into his substantial body of work. Much of the verse collected in Phantasmagoria and Other Poems has a supernatural or visionary theme. A must-read for fans of Victorian ghost stories.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd621ed635692167add5ee93ab0fca23718e07b0","amp;dn":"Lewis+Carroll+-+Phantasmagoria+And+Other+Poems+-+Epub+and+Mobi+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd621ed635692167add5ee93ab0fca23718e07b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,98,30,214,53,105,33,103,173,213,238,147,171,15,202,35,113,142,7,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
