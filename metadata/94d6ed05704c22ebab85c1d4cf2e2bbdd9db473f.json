I'm Casey Kasem, this is American Top 40, and the countdown doesn't stop until we get to number one.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThe theme to the motion picture &quot;Close Encounters Of The Third Kind&quot; is represented back-to-back by Meco at number 40 and John Williams at number 39.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;What Canadian artist has been the most successful on the American charts during the rock era?&quot; This artist has hit the chart 50 times with 12 top 10 songs.\n\nCasey answers this question: &quot;Dear Casey, You've said that Elvis and The Beatles are in first and second place with most top 10 hits during the rock era. I'd like to know who is in third place, after all, whoever it is has been up against some tough competition.&quot; Casey gives the answer.\n\nThere is an artist in the countdown that passed all his classes in high school, except for music class!\n\nA listener wants to know what female artist has had the most success with remaking old hits. Casey says this lady is also the Queen of Soul.\n\nThe week before this countdown, the four top positions on the album chart were occupied by Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Earth Wind and Fire, and Electric Light Orchestra - all with increasing sales. But this is the week the soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever leapt over all those albums, from the number 10 spot last week, to the number 1 spot this week, and would stay there 24 weeks until July.\n\n40: Theme From &quot;Close Encounters&quot; - Meco\n39: Theme From &quot;Close Encounters Of The Third Kind&quot; - John Williams\n38: You're My Soul And Inspiration - Donny &amp; Marie Osmond\n37: Happy Anniversary - The Little River Band\nEXTRA: Evil Ways - Santana\n36: As - Stevie Wonder\n35: Lovely Day - Bill Withers\n34: Ffun - Con Funk Shun\n33: Too Hot To Trot - Commodores\n32: Peg - Steely Dan\n31: Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue - Crystal Gayle\n30: Long, Long Way From Home - Foreigner\n29: Native New Yorker - Odyssey\n28: Point Of Know Return - Kansas\n27: What's Your Name - Lynyrd Skynyrd\n26: Blue Bayou - Linda Ronstadt\n25: You Can't Turn Me Off - High Energy\n24: Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood - Santa Esmerelda\n23: Emotion - Samantha Sang\n22: You Light Up My Life - Debby Boone\n21: Desiree - Neil Diamond\n20: Sentimental Lady - Bob Welch\n19: I Go Crazy - Paul Davis\n18: Dance, Dance, Dance, Yowsah Yowsah - Chic\n17: Serpentine Fire - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\n16: Turn To Stone - E.L.O.\n15: Sometimes When We Touch - Dan Hill\n14: Love Is Thicker Than Water - Andy Gibb\n13: Runaround Sue - Leif Garrett\n12: Back In Love Again - L.T.D.\n11: Just The Way You Are - Billy Joel\n10: Stayin' Alive - The Bee Gees\n9: Come Sail Away - Styx\n8: We Are The Champions - Queen\n7: Hey Deanie - Shaun Cassidy\n6: Slip Slidin' Away - Paul Simon\n5: Short People - Randy Newman\n4: You're In My Heart - Rod Stewart\n3: Here You Come Again - Dolly Parton\n2: How Deep Is Your Love - The Bee Gees\n1: Baby Come Back - Player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94d6ed05704c22ebab85c1d4cf2e2bbdd9db473f","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1978_January_21st","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94d6ed05704c22ebab85c1d4cf2e2bbdd9db473f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,214,237,5,112,76,34,235,171,133,193,212,207,46,43,189,217,219,71,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
