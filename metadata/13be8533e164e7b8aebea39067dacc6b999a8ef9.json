The melodramatic plot is redeemed by great acting and visuals - Lars Hanson was a Swedish actor who did such a fine job in The Wind.\n\nThe last five minutes are hokey, but the rest is worthwhile, including some fine shots of a sailing ship.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13be8533e164e7b8aebea39067dacc6b999a8ef9","amp;dn":"Captain+Salvation+%281927%29+Lars+Hanson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13be8533e164e7b8aebea39067dacc6b999a8ef9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,190,133,51,225,100,231,184,174,190,163,144,103,218,204,107,153,154,142,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
