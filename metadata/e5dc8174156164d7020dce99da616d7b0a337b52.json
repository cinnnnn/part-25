True to form for this chip off the old block, the young Allison injects every bit as much energy into his live shows as his father did. Bernard counts among his influences icons like Albert King, Muddy Waters, and Freddie King, and later, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Johnny Winter. He began accompanying his famous father to blues festivals in the early '70s. There, he was introduced to a who's who of Chicago blues stars: Muddy Waters, Hound Dog Taylor, and Albert King, among others. When he was seven or eight, he began having aspirations of becoming a guitar slinger like his father. Luther Allison was more than just a casual record collector, and so Bernard benefited from his father and brothers' collections of classic blues and gospel.\r\n\r\nTNT Village by caraibbo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5dc8174156164d7020dce99da616d7b0a337b52","amp;dn":"Bernard+Allison+-+Storms+Of+Life+%5BTNT+Village%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5dc8174156164d7020dce99da616d7b0a337b52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,220,129,116,21,97,100,215,2,13,206,153,218,97,109,123,10,51,123,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
