Epic and cinematic in scope, each episode unfolds with fascinating intimacy and insight revealing characters who reflect IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dramatic transformation. INDIA REBORN is a potent mixture of dreams and despair, an entertaining and informative window into a land that could soon shape the future of the world.\n\nEpisode 1\nMyth and Might\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIndians and Chinese will rule the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a prophecy and a challenge from one of the unforgettable characters you will meet in MYTH AND MIGHT, a panoramic documentary that captures the drama of epic change in the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s largest democracy.\n\nThe new superpower is emerging amid the collision of the ancient and the modern ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and MYTH AND MIGHT gives you a front row seat. Explore IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rich tapestry of myth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the flames of the ancient cremation pyres on the Ganges to the unforgettable spectacle of Navratri festivalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tens of thousands of dancers. Experience the force of IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s might ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in the mountain jungles where a war for the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s future is being fought, to the concrete streets of the capital where millions demand justice from their government.\n\nThe colourful and charismatic Lalu opens the show. Extraordinary access to IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s powerful and successful railway minister provides a closeup of the face of power. Both beloved as a saviour of the lower castes, and reviled as a corrupt opportunist, Lalu embodies IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hope and its contradictions. \n\nThe struggle for the soul of the new India is told through the stories of two brilliant doctors ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ both fiercely committed to their country, both determined to build its future. One, a rich heart surgeon, has returned home from America with a plan to build a medical system that will bring westerners to IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s door. He claims the future belongs to India. The other follows the example of his father who fought with Gandhi for IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s freedom, devoting his life to providing care and hope for IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s forgotten villagers. He fears India will dissolve into civil war. \n\nThe sublime city of Varanasi provides the backdrop for the powerful story of a fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s servitude and a sonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s redemption in IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ancient caste system. As one of IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dalits or untouchables, Ramji Choudhury is doomed to spend his life burning bodies on the cremation pyres, but a breathtaking act of rebellion will allow his eldest son to escape the hereditary fate. On the other side of the country, a bustling prosperity masks the chilling undertow of religious intolerance and a Muslim woman fears history will repeat itself in bloody violence. And in the climax of the film, the Indian government faces off against those who have been left behind by the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s race to the future. \n\nFull of dazzling spectacle and unforgettable characters, MYTH AND MIGHT is a feast for the senses and a harbinger of change for the West.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 349 MiB for 45mn 3s 672ms\nCodec             : Xvid\nSource            : HDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 958 Kbps\nAspect            : 528 x 304 (1.737) at 29.970 fps\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 112 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d58ac82cb7b3f8697c020ee147d647ccf084362a","amp;dn":"INDIA+REBORN_1+of+4_CBC+Documentary_HDTV_XviD%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d58ac82cb7b3f8697c020ee147d647ccf084362a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,138,200,44,183,179,248,105,124,2,14,225,71,214,71,204,240,132,54,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
