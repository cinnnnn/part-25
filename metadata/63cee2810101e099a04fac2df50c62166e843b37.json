Steve Russell (Carrey) is a small-town cop. Bored with his bland lifestyle, Russell turns to fraud as a means of shaking things up. Before long, Russell's criminal antics have landed him behind bars, where he encounters the charismatic Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor). Smitten, Russell devotes his entire life to being with Morris regardless of the consequences -- which could well include a life sentence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63cee2810101e099a04fac2df50c62166e843b37","amp;dn":"I+Love+You+Phillip+Morris%282010%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63cee2810101e099a04fac2df50c62166e843b37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,206,226,129,1,1,224,153,160,79,172,45,245,12,98,22,110,132,59,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
