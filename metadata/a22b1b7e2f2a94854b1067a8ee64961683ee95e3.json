Brother John \n\n&quot;Run-Around&quot; won a 1996 Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal. \n\nAlready established as a reputable act due to years of drop-dead touring, FOUR is the album that has broken Blues Traveler through to widespread ... Full Descriptionpopularity, becoming their first best-seller. Singer John Popper's frenetic harp coupled with guitarist Chan Kinchla's chicken-scratch rhythm playing make for a potent one-two punch that goes far in distinguishing Blues Traveler from the hordes of similar &quot;Grateful Dead Baby Bands&quot; that have cropped up in recent years. And while the band still retains that musical formula, FOUR explores other levels of their organic boogie. \n\nScaling back the over-extended jams of their previous records, Blues Traveler has returned as a much leaner unit. Opening with the airy &quot;Run-Around,&quot; FOUR dabbles with pretty ballads (&quot;Look Around&quot;) as well as more upbeat and sunny fare (&quot;Hook&quot;). Guest Warren Haynes' guitar playing gives &quot;The Mountain Wins Again&quot; a heavy Allman Brothers flavor, and Paul Shaffer's funky organ fills on &quot;Stand&quot; tango with Popper's scat-like vocal delivery. \n\nThe road is still Blues Traveler's true calling--it is, after all, where they became the dynamic musical force they are today. But for a studio album made by an acknowledged live band, FOUR makes for one helluva rest stop. \n\nRecorded at Bearsville Studios, Woodstock, New York. \n\nProducers: Steve Thompson, Michael Barbiero. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n \n \n \n \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a22b1b7e2f2a94854b1067a8ee64961683ee95e3","amp;dn":"Blues+Traveler+-+Four+%28EAC.FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a22b1b7e2f2a94854b1067a8ee64961683ee95e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,43,27,126,47,42,148,133,75,16,103,168,238,100,150,22,131,238,149,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
