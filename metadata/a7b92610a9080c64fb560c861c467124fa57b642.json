But the Shadow Riders are doing the same and not all nations are opposed to their rule. New discoveries are made, old wounds are reopened and betrayal hides among welcoming smiles. As one nation begins to unravel it's clear that some choices, even those made with the best of intentions, can have devastating consequences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7b92610a9080c64fb560c861c467124fa57b642","amp;dn":"Tears+of+War_+Dragon%27s+Call+Book+Two.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7b92610a9080c64fb560c861c467124fa57b642","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,185,38,16,169,8,12,100,251,86,12,134,28,70,113,36,250,87,182,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
