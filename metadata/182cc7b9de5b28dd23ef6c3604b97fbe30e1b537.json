From something as simple as skull shape variations to much more extreme and grotesque divergences from the norm, some of the footage will astound you, and some will disturb you, but it will all keep your interest.\n\nThe production has a bit of an artistic flair, with frequent montages of cross-processed film footage put to a chic soundtrack. It could be argued that it's a bit of a vanity project for host Armand Leroi -- the camera conspicuously dwells on him a significant portion of the time, including some of the more music video-like moments -- but he is charismatic enough to pull it off without detracting from the overall presentation.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:182cc7b9de5b28dd23ef6c3604b97fbe30e1b537","amp;dn":"Human+Mutants++%28Channel+4++2004+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"182cc7b9de5b28dd23ef6c3604b97fbe30e1b537","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,44,199,185,222,91,40,221,35,239,108,54,4,185,127,190,48,225,181,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
