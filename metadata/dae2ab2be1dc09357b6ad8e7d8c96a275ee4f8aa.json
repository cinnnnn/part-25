It also incorporates EU directives and references to harmonised and international standards.\r\n\r\nReflecting the importance of the roles of directors and managers in health and safety, new chapters cover the management of risk, emphasising the need for a sound organisational structure to achieve effective risk management. Developments in the behavioural approach to risk management and current thinking on the development of an international standard on safety management are also covered.\r\n\r\nQuality of the environment is rapidly becoming part of the safety manager's responsibilities both in the workplace and in the context of global pollution. A completely new part consisting of five chapters has been added dealing solely with environmental issues (including ISO 14001).\r\n\r\nThe increasingly important role of ergonomics in health and safety is reflected in a new chapter on Applied Ergonomics, dealing with the subject pragmatically, that will allow the manager and practitioner to design process and operations that are within the limits of the human body. The effects of stress, an emerging concern in health and safety, are covered in various chapters. \r\n\r\n* The leading book on the subject of occupational safety that covers all aspects of safety management.\r\n* Revised to include changes in health, safety, employment and environmental legislation and issues.\r\n* Covers information required for NEBOSH and IOSH qualifications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dae2ab2be1dc09357b6ad8e7d8c96a275ee4f8aa","amp;dn":"Safety+At+Work+6th+ed+-+John+Ridley+and+John+Channing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dae2ab2be1dc09357b6ad8e7d8c96a275ee4f8aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,226,171,43,225,220,9,53,123,106,216,231,216,201,106,39,94,228,248,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
