But what is not widely known is that there are deep and long-standing connections between Islamic teachings and environmentalism. In this groundbreaking book, Ibrahim Abdul-Matin draws on research, scripture, and interviews with Muslim Americans to trace IslamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preoccupation with humankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s collective role as stewards of the Earth. Abdul-Matin points out that the Prophet Muhammad declared that Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Earth is a mosque.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nDeen means Ã¢â‚¬Å“pathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“wayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Arabic. Abdul-Matin offers dozens of examples of how Muslims can follow, and already are following, a Green Deen in four areas: Ã¢â‚¬Å“waste, watts (energy), water, and food.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ At last, people of all beliefs can appreciate the gifts and contributions that Islam and Muslims bring to the environmental movement.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7492ba631c6191f602dc064ec923eede9f59b84","amp;dn":"Ibrahim+Abdul-Matin+-+Green+Deen%3B+What+Islam+Teaches+about+Prote","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7492ba631c6191f602dc064ec923eede9f59b84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,73,43,166,49,198,25,31,96,45,192,100,236,146,62,237,233,245,155,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
