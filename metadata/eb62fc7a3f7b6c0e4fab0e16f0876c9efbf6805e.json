Joining him is his old friend Phil Adams, a Defense Intelligence Agency counterintelligence case officer based in Washington State.\r\nReckless banking practices, hyperinflation, and government negligence have led to an unprecedented socioeconomic collapse in America that quickly spreads throughout the world. Lightly populated Bella Coola is spared the worst of the chaos, but when order is restored it comes in the form of a tyrannical army of occupation. Ray and Phil soon become key players in the resistance movement, fighting the occupiers in a war that will determine not only their own personal survival, but also the future of North America","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb62fc7a3f7b6c0e4fab0e16f0876c9efbf6805e","amp;dn":"James+Wesley+Rawles+-Liberators","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb62fc7a3f7b6c0e4fab0e16f0876c9efbf6805e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,98,252,122,63,123,108,14,79,171,14,22,240,135,108,158,251,246,128,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
