After waking up in the middle of the night to mysterious sounds, you start a journey in the dark looking for your mother. \r\nThe game lets you experience the horror felt by a child when familiar and friendly surroundings are transformed into something sinister. While wandering around in surrealistic environments, you have only your teddy bear as a companion. There might be threats hiding in every shadow, but thereâ€™s no traditional combat. Instead, you will actively have to find places to hide and avoid confrontation in order to survive. In Among the Sleep youâ€™re vulnerable, scared, and trying to make sense of the world. Dark things will happen. How will you find comfort?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e01633665f1e8017b7476c1913a2ab6e217cc07b","amp;dn":"Among+the+Sleep+%28v2.4.0.11%29+%5BGOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e01633665f1e8017b7476c1913a2ab6e217cc07b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,22,51,102,95,30,128,23,183,71,108,25,19,162,171,110,33,124,192,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
