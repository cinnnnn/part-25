A harrowing, powerful debut thriller about finding yourself and protecting your futureÃ¢â‚¬â€no matter how short and uncertain it may be. \n\nThe Arclight is the last defense. The Fade canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get in. Outside the ArclightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s border of high-powered beams is the Dark. And between the Light and the Dark is the Grey, a narrow, barren no-manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s-land. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where the rescue team finds Marina, a lone teenage girl with no memory of the horrors she faced or the family she lost. Marina is the only person who has ever survived an encounter with the Fade. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the first hope humanity has had in generations, but she could also be the catalyst for their final destruction. Because the Fade will stop at nothing to get her back. Marina knows it. Tobin, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to take his revenge on the Fade, knows it. Anne-Marie, who just wishes it were all over, knows it.\n\nWhen one of the Fade infiltrates the Arclight and Marina recognizes it, she will begin to unlock secrets she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even know she had. Who will Marina become? Who can she never be again?\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b8bc79afcadf5dec8d8486b8a03799db4dda128","amp;dn":"Arclight+%28Arclight+%231%29+by+Josin+L.+McQuein+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b8bc79afcadf5dec8d8486b8a03799db4dda128","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,139,199,154,252,173,245,222,200,216,72,107,138,3,121,157,180,221,161,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
