From the makers of 'The Battleships', 'The Airships' series reveals the dynamic role these remarkable flying machines played in history, peacetime and war in 3 enthralling episodes. Steeped in the dramas of international political intrigue, it is a saga of extraordinary men and nations in a quest to dominate the skies.\n\nAirships pioneered aerial bombing; made the first around-the-world passenger flight; carried explorers to the North Pole; established the first aerial passenger services between Europe, New York,and South America; and became flying aircraft carriers in the US Navy.\n\nThe Hindenburg disaster all but destroyed their credibility. But today, more airships are flying than ever before, designed and built by a new breed of aviation pioneers. Craft designed to rival satellites in the stratosphere, to transport enormous cargoes, and to act as surveillance and communication platforms herald a new age for the air.\n\nEpisodes include:\n1. Lift off (1890-1922)\n2. Ship of dreams (1923-1930)\n3. Forced Landing (1931-present and beyond)\n\n\n==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch\nxvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide\nthe knob a little to the right (not too much) it\nreally makes a big difference to the video output\ntry it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org\nit rid the noise and washed out feel and\nbrighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU\nacceleration can really help playback speeds\ntry this before complaining about corrupted video\nand bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids\nworse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better\nhowever Im still wondering if ver 1.11.1 plays\nbetter as it seems more smooth.
