For Norman enthusiasts, you may know this original version is MUCH different than the later releases on vinyl and years later on cd.  Whether it was not getting all the masters from capitol, or whether he wanted to tinker with it later, I don't really know, but here it is.  \n\nI paid high dollar on ebay for this record after years of searching for one.  I may even like the later version better, but this is a very interesting time piece in Christian music history.\n\nPlease seed, as this is pretty rare, and you won't find it on cd any time soon, if ever.\n\n\nIt's been a long time since I've uploaded a torrent, so if you have any problems, please let me know.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afdc5207e28c42c9fceef5520849e7dfefbf68e8","amp;dn":"Larry+Norman+-+Upon+This+Rock+%28Original+Capitol+Version%29+vinyl+r","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afdc5207e28c42c9fceef5520849e7dfefbf68e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,220,82,7,226,140,66,201,252,238,245,82,8,73,231,223,239,191,104,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
