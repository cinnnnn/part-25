It gained a cult following and is still recognized as one of the best Polish comics.&quot; (Wikipedia)\n\nI would like to highlight the fact that this English scan was not based on the Polish original, but on its Hungarian translation made by IstvÃƒÂ¡n Nemere in the 1980s. I myself am not fluent in Polish, therefore I had no chance to compare it with the original, but I reckon there shouldn't be too big differences.  But for one thing, the Hungarian text methodically referred to the Drolls as &quot;furcsÃƒÂ¡k&quot; - &quot;strange ones&quot; and I decided to stick to it for the moment in the English text, too.\n\nThis is the V1.0 version, before proof-reading. \n\n\nBook Two will hopefully be finished at around June 2013, unless somebody else does it before me.\n\nAs for Book Three and Four, these unfortunately have not yet been published in Hungarian, so I would need the help of somebody with a good understanding of Polish to help me out. If interested, just leave me a message here or directly, please...\n\nThank you.\n\nCheck SWATura torrents for other hard-to-find classics!\n\n(K) Kopyleft 2013 - All Rites Reversed...\n\np.s.
