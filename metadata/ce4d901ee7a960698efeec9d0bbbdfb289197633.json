Get it here!\n\nIt's suitable for anyone - if you've never tried DF before, or played for years - because while I've set up all the included parts already, the core is as easily accessible to you:  you can add, remove, update, replace whatever you want to and customise the pack as much as you want.  The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.\n\nChangelog:\n - downgraded TwbT to v3.37 and restored associated plugins\n - fixed item overrides in installed Phoebus graphics\n - reduced multilevel view to five levels; should reduce performance hit\n\nMD5: 5CFA70E02AA1CBFC78557B47E09E06B0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce4d901ee7a960698efeec9d0bbbdfb289197633","amp;dn":"Dwarf+Fortress+40_10+Starter+Pack+r4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce4d901ee7a960698efeec9d0bbbdfb289197633","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,77,144,30,231,169,96,105,142,254,236,157,11,187,223,178,137,25,118,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
