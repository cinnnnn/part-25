Her mother, Kathi, a notorious local figure, was a drug addict and sometimes dealer whose life swung between welfare and riches, and whose highbrow taste was at odds with her hardscrabble life. And yet she managed, despite the chaos she created, to instill in her daughter a love of stories. Kathi frequently kept Domenica home from school to watch such classics as the Godfather movies and everything by Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen, telling her, Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is more important. I promise. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll thank me later.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And despite the fact that there was not a book to be found in her household, Domenica developed a love of reading, which helped her believe that she could transcend this life of undying grudges, self-inflicted misfortune, and the crooked moral code that Kathi and her cohorts lived by.\n\nWith or Without You is the story of Domenica RutaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unconventional coming of ageÃ¢â‚¬â€a darkly hilarious chronicle of a misfit Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s youth and the necessary and painful act of breaking away, and of overcoming her own addictions and demons in the process. In a brilliant stylistic feat, Ruta has written a powerful, inspiring, compulsively readable, and finally redemptive story about loving and leaving.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fda10e143bd6f8dc8c0caeeff4404ac3fbeaa4a7","amp;dn":"With+or+Without+You%3A+A+Memoir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fda10e143bd6f8dc8c0caeeff4404ac3fbeaa4a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,161,14,20,59,214,248,220,140,12,174,239,244,64,74,195,251,234,164,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
