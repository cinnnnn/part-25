Richard RojcewiczÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elegant translation offers the English-speaking reader intimate contact with one of the most basic Heideggerian concepts. This book lays out how the event is to be understood and ties it closely to looking, showing, self-manifestation, and the self-unveiling of the gods. The Event (Complete Works, volume 71) is part of a series of Heidegger's private writings in response to Contributions.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: Studies in Continental Thought\nPDF: 336 pages\nPublisher: Indiana University Press (December 27, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0253006864\nISBN-13: 978-0253006868\nAmazon Link:\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ad02b751e88482b2444f9d48e30fa5f0dda7828","amp;dn":"+The+Event+%28Studies+in+Continental+Thought%29+%282012%29+%7B%3DIMPAVIDUS%3D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ad02b751e88482b2444f9d48e30fa5f0dda7828","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,208,43,117,30,136,72,43,36,68,249,212,142,48,250,95,13,218,120,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
