If weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re lucky, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a dash to the nearest supermarket to grab a few items for trusted but boring everyday meals. At worst, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fast food, leaving your family soaked in MSG and trans fatty acids, and you full of guilt! There must be a happy middle ground. Enter Fuss-free Suppers. Super cooks Jenny Kay and Elinor Storkey show you how to create meals with the minimum of fuss and time, and which your family will love. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all in the planning and organisation. With the right tools and equipment, a well-stocked pantry (all covered in the book), and this selection of recipes, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be a new person Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at least in the kitchen! Chapters include chicken, beef, pork, lamb, fish, pizza and pasta, vegetarian and side dishes.\n\nAbout the Authors\nJenny Kay has worked in the food industry for almost three decades with baking and teaching featuring prominently.
