The American version of the album included a song originally recorded by The Everly Brothers, and also covered by Roy Orbison, the melodic ballad &quot;Love Hurts&quot;, that was released as a hit single in the UK and in the U.S., where it went platinum. The track became the band's only U.S. Top Ten hit.[4] The song spent a record-shattering 60 weeks on the Norwegian chart.[4]\n\nIn 1979, second guitarist Zal Cleminson was added to the line-up, remaining for two albums, No Mean City and Malice in Wonderland, and contributing numerous compositions.[2] Malice in Wonderland produced a popular AOR single called &quot;Holiday&quot;.[3] In 1981, they contributed the song &quot;Crazy (A Suitable Case for Treatment)&quot; to the soundtrack to the film, Heavy Metal.\n\nVarious Nazareth line-ups continued to make studio albums and tour throughout the 1980s and 1990s, although their popularity had declined such that some albums no longer received either a UK or a U.S. release. They remained popular in Europe, particularly Germany, where &quot;Dream On&quot; became a hit single. Billy Rankin returned for a second spell in the ranks in 1991 for the No Jive album, replacing Manny Charlton who pursued a solo career.[2]\n\nAn unlikely tribute came in 1993 when Guns N' Roses covered Nazareth's &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot; on &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;, consolation after they turned down Axl Rose's request for the group to play at his wedding.[2] Rankin departed again in 1994, but with Jimmy Murrison and keyboard player Ronnie Leahy, Nazareth maintained a live following in Europe and the U.S.[2]\n\nIn 1999, while touring the U.S., original drummer Darrell Sweet died at age 51 of a heart attack. He was replaced by bassist Pete Agnew's son Lee for later editions of the band.\n\nIn February 2008, an album was released on the Hamburg based label Edel Entertainment entitled The Newz. The release of the album coincided with Nazareth's fortieth anniversary tour which started on 25 January in Sweden and visited most of Europe, finishing on 4 November 2008 in Norway. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits 1975\n\n\nGreatest Hits was a Nazareth album released in 1975, by which time Nazareth had experienced considerable success with albums and singles. This showcased tracks from the band's third album Razamanaz through to their sixth album Hair of the Dog, with some non-album singles.\n\nAs part of the remastering of Nazareth's back-catalogue in the mid-1990s, the original album was expanded to encompass the self-titled first album through to the ninth studio offering, Expect No Mercy , whilst retaining the original running-order of the vinyl release.\n\nAs part of the same CD-remastering programme, Greatest Hits Volume II was released in 1998, on CD only. This covered the later period of the band.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\tRazamanaz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n2.\tHoly Roller ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n3.\tShanghai'd in Shanghai ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n4.\tLove Hurts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n5.\tTurn On Your Receiver ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n6.\tBad Bad Boy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n7.\tThis Flight Tonight ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n8.\tBroken Down Angel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46\n9.\tHair of the Dog ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n10.\tSunshine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n11.\tMy White Bicycle (Hopkins, Burgess) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28\n12.\tWoke Up This Morning ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8579652b0086b671efe686f859ef1cfc722ff621","amp;dn":"Nazareth+-+Greatest+Hits+1975+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8579652b0086b671efe686f859ef1cfc722ff621","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,121,101,43,0,134,182,113,239,230,134,248,89,239,28,252,114,47,246,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
