Since the hot topics of green chemistry and green processes are of a multidisciplinary interest, this book will benefit the whole spectrum of the process industry, including chemical engineers, process engineers, apparatus construction engineers, chemical industry, chemists in industry, and biotechnologists.\nThe editors and authors are all internationally recognized experts from industry and academia, including Dr. Patrick Gruber, the former Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of Cargill Dow, a winner of the U.S. Presidential Green Chemistry Award and holder of more than 40 patents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57610ae7af429fb185b5341d1d0bf1ce5ff4edae","amp;dn":"Biorefineries+%26ndash%3B+Industrial+Processes+and+Products","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57610ae7af429fb185b5341d1d0bf1ce5ff4edae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,97,10,231,175,66,159,177,133,181,52,29,29,11,241,206,95,244,237,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
