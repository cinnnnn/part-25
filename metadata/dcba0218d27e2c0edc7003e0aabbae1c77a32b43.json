Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.\n\nI just want adorable cat-shifter-kitty-petting/cuddling. Maybe the shifter retains some cat-like characteristics even when human/in his human form. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily have to be a housecat. It could be a big cat of some sort. Just, you know, with petting and cuddling and adorableness (in human and cat forms if you can fit it). And maybe some playing with the tail (not tail sex, just playing with the tail).\nGenre: Romance MM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcba0218d27e2c0edc7003e0aabbae1c77a32b43","amp;dn":"Complicated+-+J.J.+Cassidy.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcba0218d27e2c0edc7003e0aabbae1c77a32b43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,186,2,24,210,126,44,14,220,112,3,224,170,187,174,28,119,163,43,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
