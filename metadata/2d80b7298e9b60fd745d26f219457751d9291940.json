If It Was Love Reprise\n\n\n&quot;Sweet Paradise&quot;, Rita's 8th release, continues in her tradition of bringing us songs that we can all relate to in a manner and voice that draws a more meaningful inner connection between herself and her audience. Rita sings her songs from her soul and in doing so, touches ours.\n\n&quot;Sweet Paradise&quot;, which Rita co-produced with George Koller, consists of 12 songs, all brought into remarkable focus from the experiences she had drawn on from her time spent in Mississippi and Louisiana, over the last few years. From down home Swampy Blues to Soul Searching Roots, combined with a little tinge of Country Feel, &quot;Sweet Paradise&quot; more than covers the gamut of emotions one expects when listening to Rita, in all her glory.&quot;Sweet Paradise&quot; is a very fine example of what this cherished Canadian Singer - Songwriter is all about, and that is one whom has the profound ability to connect with her fans on all levels.\n\nI give this CD, my highest rating, Five ***** Excellent CD... Thoroughly enjoyed it... Highly Recommended...\n\n\nThere are not enough words in the lexicon of blues to describe just how good this woman's voice is.   And I won't even attempt it:...\n\n...so here goes: maybe not, can't find the superlatives I'm searching for.\n\nAnd listen to the last track on the album.   An incredible soul-searching, heart-breaking torch song.   One of the best torch songs you will ever hear.   Better even than I Who Have Nothing; and possibly even better than If You Go Away.\n\nYou have got to listen to this, guys; for fuck sake you have got to listen to this.
