It's kind of a meeting of two comedy generations. Released on video ages ago, it has yet to make it to DVD or the internet until now (as far as I have been able to make out).\n\nVideo is just over an hour, scanned hi-res from a first-generation tape. Special musical guest is Willie Nelson.\n\nHighlights:\n* B&amp;R do their version of &quot;Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?&quot; with the girls\n* Willie Nelson and Leon Russell perform &quot;One For My Baby&quot;\n* The non-identical McBeeBee twins, a longstanding B&amp;R favorite.\n\nVideo: 1:08:10\nRes: 720x480\nCompression: XVid 2000kbps video, mp3 128kbps audio\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c747f72c2298439149eef7a94a107d19e7067797","amp;dn":"Bob+and+Ray%2C+Jane+Laraine+and+Gilda.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c747f72c2298439149eef7a94a107d19e7067797","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,71,247,44,34,152,67,145,73,238,247,169,74,16,125,25,231,6,119,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
