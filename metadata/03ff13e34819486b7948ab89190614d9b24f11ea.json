Rand says that he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think that Democrats Ã¢â‚¬Å“poll testedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ their use of the phrase Ã¢â‚¬Å“we wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t negotiate.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right, RandÃ¢â‚¬â€not everybody has to poll test the things they say because most people wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t otherwise be saying things that horrify people. Rand relies on poll-tested phrases because he learned long ago that if he just says what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really thinking then nobody would vote for himÃ¢â‚¬â€even in Kentucky! \n\nStorms are bearing down on the US, as government meteorologists have been sent home due to the shutdown. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like a perfect storm of Republican stupidity.\nThe lack of meteorologists is no problem to the Republican base. They just think Ã¢â‚¬Å“Meteorologists? Hell, we ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gonna get hit by no meteors.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAlong with shutting down the government, I think the Republicans have shut down whatever brains they had left. With that in mind, they should probably shut their mouths down too. Alex Jones was calling the car chase/shooting death incident in DC a Ã¢â‚¬Å“false flagÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ operation even while it was still ongoing! Everything is a false flag to Alex. Does he even think that real flags exist?\n\nGlenn Beck says that ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s next move after shutting down the national monuments is going to be mass killings of millions of people. Then maybe the House Republicans should pass a CR. It will foil ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s diabolical plot and save millions of lives.\n\nRepublican Congressman Todd Rokita was having a back and forth with CNN anchor Carol Costello when he suddenly seemed to want to make it into a whole another kind of back and forth. Rokita said Ã¢â‚¬Å“Carol, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re beautiful but you need to be honest as well.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve heard of Republican talking points. What is this, some kind of creepy Republican sweet-talking points? I hope that occurred close to the end of Carol CostelloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s show, because I bet she felt that she needed to take a shower as soon as possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03ff13e34819486b7948ab89190614d9b24f11ea","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+October+04+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03ff13e34819486b7948ab89190614d9b24f11ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,255,19,227,72,25,72,107,121,72,171,137,25,6,20,217,178,79,17,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
