Does the concentration of environmental pollutants exert cytotoxic or cytostatic effects on cells? What factors influence the rate and timing of cell proliferation? Researchers in basic, industrial, and medical research are asking these questions and looking for answers. Understanding the normal regulation of cell death and cell proliferation will be critical e.g., for the development of new and more successful therapies for preventing and treating cancer and for the screening of new anti-cancer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:634dc1cffac6d20d83b0ce09d77e608d8c4e61c1","amp;dn":"Apoptosis+and+Cell+Proliferation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"634dc1cffac6d20d83b0ce09d77e608d8c4e61c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,77,193,207,250,198,210,13,131,176,206,9,215,126,96,141,140,78,97,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
