At school, the only people who acknowledge Elena are Dora's friends and Jimmy Zenk - who failed at least one grade and wears black every day of the week. And at home, Elena's parents keep arguing with each other. Elena will do anything to help her sister get better and get their lives back to normal - even when the responsibility becomes too much to bear.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35970e67159707a283d4ad3104ab3622e872c50a","amp;dn":"Julie+Schumacher+-+Black+Box","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35970e67159707a283d4ad3104ab3622e872c50a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,151,14,103,21,151,7,162,131,212,173,49,4,171,54,34,232,114,197,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
