ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an eclectic collection of songs that werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really on the mapÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and I like it so much because if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a surprise to the fans, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a surprise to me, as well.&quot;\n\nThis is the latest Clapton's album released. Most of the songs, if not all, seem to be new, and they pretty much show how good the man still is. \n\nAmazon link with previews and album cover (though the files already have art embedded): http://www.amazon.com/Clapton-Eric/dp/B003XMUFGQ\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42e7bc8f4269829d4cab15f2aebe1246765bea75","amp;dn":"Eric+Clapton+-+Clapton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42e7bc8f4269829d4cab15f2aebe1246765bea75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,231,188,143,66,105,130,157,76,171,21,242,174,190,18,70,118,91,234,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
