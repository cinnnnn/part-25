It is also where a bitterly sarcastic sharp-eyed PI Lewton tries to earn a living solving bizarre cases. A mysterious woman named Carlotta hires him to find her lost lover. Wandering through the dark city and gathering evidence, Lewton has to solve the case, confront a sinister conspiracy, and once again become torn between love and despair.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:967b5b552be0d04f5415ab1befcd0b2ea608e82f","amp;dn":"Discworld+Noir%28PC+GAME%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"967b5b552be0d04f5415ab1befcd0b2ea608e82f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,123,91,85,43,224,208,79,84,21,171,27,239,205,11,46,166,8,232,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
