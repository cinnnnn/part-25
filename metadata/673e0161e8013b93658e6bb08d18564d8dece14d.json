On a whim she buys the derelict Windmill theatre in the West End and persuades impresario Vivian Van Damm to run it, despite the fact the two don't seem to get on at all. Although their idea of a non-stop revue is at first a success, other theatres copy it and disaster looms. Laura suggests they put nudes in the show, but Van Damm points out that the Lord Chamberlain, who licenses live shows in Britain, is likely to have something to say about this. Luckily Mrs Henderson is friends with him.\nSummary written by ...@aber.ac.uk\n\nUser Comments: Gently amusing British wartime film with superb music (more)\n\nUser Rating: *******___ 7.0/10 (472 votes)\t\n\nCast (in credits order)\nJudi Dench\t.... \tLaura Henderson\nBob Hoskins\t.... \tVivian Van Damm\nWill Young\t.... \tBertie\nKelly Reilly\t.... \tMaureen\nThelma Barlow\t.... \tLady Conway\nChristopher Guest\t.... \tLord Cromer\nrest of cast listed alphabetically:\nKaren Aspinall\t.... \tDancer\nElise Audeyev\t.... \tMillerette\nSamuel Barnett\t.... \tPaul\nAnna Brewster\t.... \tDoris\nRosalind Halstead\t.... \tFrances\nVictoria Hay\t.... \tMillerette\nShona McWilliams\t.... \tGracie Kramer\nCamille O'Sullivan\t.... \tJane\nDoraly Rosen\t.... \tMaggie\nSarah Solemani\t.... \tVera\nNatalia Tena\t.... \tPeggy\n\nAlso Known As:\nMrs. Henderson Presents (UK) (working title)\nMPAA: Rated R for nudity and brief language.\nRuntime: 103 min\nCountry: UK\nLanguage: English\nColor: Color\nSound Mix: Dolby Digital\nCertification: Brazil:16 / UK:12A / USA:R / Netherlands:MG6 / Australia:M / Canada:G (Quebec) / Ireland:15A / Canada:PG (British Columbia/Manitoba/Ontario)\n\nAwards: Nominated for 3 Golden Globes.
