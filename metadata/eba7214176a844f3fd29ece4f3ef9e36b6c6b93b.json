It was made at Steve's CLEAR SOUNDS studio the band left the album solely for Steve to do, in order to get over hes divorce. I suppose this is Humble pies white album because it ranges all over the place and it leans towards the soul side of the pie, that was produced in THUNDERBOX. and the live tracks at the end are all out rockers. Even if this album was just here for one song it would be BECKTON DUMPS because that is so cool. Anyway sit back and enjoy!!! PLEASE GO TO THE RE-SEED VERSION THAT ONE IS UPLOADING","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eba7214176a844f3fd29ece4f3ef9e36b6c6b93b","amp;dn":"Humble+Pie+-+EAT+IT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eba7214176a844f3fd29ece4f3ef9e36b6c6b93b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,167,33,65,118,168,68,243,253,41,236,228,243,239,158,54,182,198,185,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
