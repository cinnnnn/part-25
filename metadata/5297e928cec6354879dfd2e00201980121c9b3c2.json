At a certain point both fans and record company turn away from your music and focus on what's hot now. ZZ Top, I think, has suffered this fate. While they still continue to make good music, no one seems to be listening anymore. Fine. I still like them. I still buy their cds. This compilation is the only best of ZZ Top that's worth buying for now. They really should have two disc or three disc retrospective like The Cars have and ELO has. However, this one disc compiles some of their greatest 70's and 80's hits in one place with a couple of new songs for 1992, &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; and &quot;Gun Love.&quot; At 18 tracks this is a nice buy. No extensive liner notes though. After 1992, ZZ Top released Antenna in 1994, which dropped the synthesizers and went back to hard rocking blues. Then they released 1996's Rhythmeen, which seemed like they were going for a more mud-swamp, mid-tempo hard rock blues. In 1999 they released XXX which finds them still rocking the blues but with a bit more fun like they had before 1990's Recycler. This Greatest Hits, however, is perfect for those wanting a sample. This is a must have for any rock collector.\n\nby Jason Stein\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Gimme All Your Lovin'.wma                              \n02 - Sharp Dressed Man.wma                                  \n03 - Rough Boy.wma                                          \n04 - Tush.wma                                               \n05 - My Head's In Mississippi.wma                           \n06 - Pearl Necklace.wma                                     \n07 - I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide.wma                            \n08 - Viva Las Vegas.wma                                     \n09 - Doubleback.wma                                         \n10 - Gun Love.wma                                           \n11 - Got Me Under Pressure.wma                              \n12 - Give It Up.wma                                         \n13 - Cheap Sunglasses.wma                                   \n14 - Sleeping Bag.wma                                       \n15 - Planet Of Women.wma                                    \n16 - La Grange.wma                                          \n17 - Tube Snake Boogie.wma                                  \n18 - Legs.wma         \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5297e928cec6354879dfd2e00201980121c9b3c2","amp;dn":"ZZ+Top+-+Greatest+Hits+%281992%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5297e928cec6354879dfd2e00201980121c9b3c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,151,233,40,206,198,53,72,121,223,210,224,2,1,152,1,33,201,179,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
