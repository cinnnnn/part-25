Gwen took her time to carefully craft her new album This Is What The Truth Looks Like, her most personal work to date. With intimate songs such as Make Me Like You , Misery Truth and Used To Love You combined with the stellar productions from producers Mattman &amp; Robin, Greg Kurstin, JR Rotem and Stargate, there is an emotional through line to the album that highlights Gwen s songwriting and impassioned themes of love and loss that are universally felt worldwide. Gwen is always looking for a new challenge which recently took the shape of TV judge on the NBC hit The Voice.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01. Misery 3:26\r\n02. Youâ€™re My Favorite 2:56\r\n03.
