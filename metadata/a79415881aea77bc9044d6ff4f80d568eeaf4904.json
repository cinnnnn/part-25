It's a similarly laid-back album,\nwith a rambling pace and low-key delivery. Some of the tracks sound like\nstudio jams but it all adds to the overall charm. This Japanese issue is\nthe only official CD release for this album.\n\n\nTracks:\n01 Watcha Gonna Do (Doherty/Woodward)\n02 Neighbors (Lapano/Woodward)\n03 Gathering The Words (Lapano/Woodward)\n04 Don't You Be Fooled (Doherty)\n05 Got A Feelin' (Phillips/Doherty)\n06 Tuesday Morning (Doherty/Fischer/Woodward/McGuire)\n07 Still Can't Hear The Music (Doherty/Woodward)\n08 Hey Good Looking (Williams)\n09 The Drummer's Song (Fischer/Woodward)\n10 Here Comes The Sun/Two Of Us (Harrison/Lennon/McCartney)\n\n\nReview from AMG:\nDenny Doherty, the voice of numerous Mamas &amp; Papas hits was one of the greatest \nand most underrated lead vocalists of the rock era. This, his fist solo album, \nhas numerous charms. The record has a loose, party-in -the-studio feel, and much \nof that adds to the overall effect of this slightly country-oriented platter. \nTracks such as &quot;Gathering of the Words&quot; and &quot;Don't You Be Fooled&quot; are quite \nremarkable, and show Doherty to be a sensitive artist in the singer-songwriter \nvein. A remake of &quot;&quot;Got a Feelin'&quot; features Doherty's world class talent as a \nvocalist as well. The album's closer, a medley of &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and &quot;Two \nof Us&quot; ends the record in grand style, with Jimmy Haskall's exquisite string \narrangement taking the listener into a wonderful and warm place.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a79415881aea77bc9044d6ff4f80d568eeaf4904","amp;dn":"Denny+Doherty+-+Watcha+Gonna+Do+%281971%29+%5Bmp3+V0%5D+%7B2002+Japan+MCA%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a79415881aea77bc9044d6ff4f80d568eeaf4904","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,148,21,136,26,234,119,188,144,68,214,255,79,128,213,104,238,175,73,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
