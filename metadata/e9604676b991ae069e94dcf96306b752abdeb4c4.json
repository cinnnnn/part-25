The Maniac, however, constantly outsmarts the dim-witted Bertozzo and, when Bertozzo leaves the room, intercepts a phone call from Inspector Pissani. The phone call lets the Maniac know that a judge is due at the police station to investigate the interrogation and death of the anarchist. The Maniac decides to impersonate the judge, and successfully does so. He gets the police to re-enact the events, in the actual fourth floor room, and also involves a woman journalist who is trying to probe the events","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9604676b991ae069e94dcf96306b752abdeb4c4","amp;dn":"Accidental+Death+of+an+Anarchist.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9604676b991ae069e94dcf96306b752abdeb4c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,96,70,118,185,145,174,6,158,148,220,249,99,6,183,82,171,222,180,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
