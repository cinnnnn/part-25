The classical-romantic music of the 19th century and the popular electronic music of the present. Pieces such as ?Hymnus? or ?Funeral March? are examples of this.\n\nIt is my attempt to combine traditional instruments such as the piano, the clarinet or string instrument, including traditional melodies and harmonies, with electronically generated sounds from synthesizers and samplers, and modern rhythms.\n\nThis resulted in new stereophonic sounds. Virtual stereophonics produced by the electronic music are combined to the known and experienced stereophonics of traditional music (the so called, ?classical music?). in turn, the sound archieves more depth and scope, stereophonics and composition become equal partners during the production of music\n\nThe title of the CD ?Songs No Words?, and the individual tracks, arebased on the style from the piano album ?Lieder ohne Worte? by Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, published in 1834.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c5f7b8360d5f60e3927d3dcf2efa3eb73a68825","amp;dn":"Johannes+Schmoelling+-+Lieder+Ohne+Worte-Songs+No+Words+%2CNew+Age","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c5f7b8360d5f60e3927d3dcf2efa3eb73a68825","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,95,123,131,96,213,246,14,57,39,211,220,242,239,163,235,115,166,136,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
