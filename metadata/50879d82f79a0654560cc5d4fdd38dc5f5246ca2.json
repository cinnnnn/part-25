This volume examines key      \n   questions in Electoral Geography and examines the changes that have       \n   occurred over the last 30years.                                           \n\n  +-[ ALEXANDRIA ]----------------------------------------------------------+\n  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :\n  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :\n  : of the ancient world.
