C. Fung (Author), Pin Tong (Author)\n\nISBN-10: 9810241240 | ISBN-13: 978-9810241247 | Publication Date: June 2001\n\nWritten for engineers and engineering scientists, this book gives first priority to the formulation of problems, presenting the classical results as the gold standard, and the numerical approach as a tool for obtaining solutions. The classical part is a revision of the text &quot;Foundations of Solid Mechanics&quot;, with a much-expanded discussion on the theories of plasticity and large elastic deformation with finite strains. The computational part is all new and aims to solve major linear and nonlinear boundary-value problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0954e66e491e0052d498b65c2ac90672fdd389cf","amp;dn":"+Classical+and+Computational+Solid+Mechanics+-+Fung%2C+Tong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0954e66e491e0052d498b65c2ac90672fdd389cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,84,230,110,73,30,0,82,212,152,182,92,42,201,6,114,253,211,137,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
