It was Canada's first completed subway system, with the first line being built under Yonge Street, which opened in 1954 with 12 stations. Since then, the system has expanded to become Canada's largest rapid transit rail network and the second busiest, behind the Montreal Metro, in number of daily ridership, encompassing four lines and 69 stations on 70 kilometres (43 mi) of track. The subway system is a very popular mode of public transport in Toronto, with an average of 948,100 passenger trips each weekday (as of Q1 2010).\n\nThe TTC sometimes uses the term &quot;rapid transit&quot; internally to describe all four lines, but in public usage they are called subway lines, with the exception of the Scarborough RT, which is simply called &quot;the RT&quot;.\n\nCurrent priorities for expansion is extending the western branch of the Yonge-University-Spadina line north of Toronto, creating a new line under Eglinton Avenue, and extending the Sheppard line in both directions from its current termini.\n\n=====================================\n\nPreview: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/paiiHAadB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/paiiHAadB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pAIIIAAdb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pAIIIAAdb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PAIiJAaDb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PAIiJAaDb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PAIikAAdB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PAIikAAdB&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d189bee8ee970c754a55438ff3b7dcf9074ec95","amp;dn":"Toronto+Subway+%28Jose+Ongpin%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d189bee8ee970c754a55438ff3b7dcf9074ec95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,24,155,238,142,233,112,199,84,165,84,56,255,59,125,207,144,116,236,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
