Along with those of Paul Godwin andMarek Weber, his orchestra became one of the most popular in Germany and gained a high reputation abroad. \n\nHe played a range of music, but for jazz music often recorded under different names, such as The Odeon Five, MacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jazz Orchestra and the Clive Williams Jazzband.\n\nAs soon as the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933 BÃƒÂ©la, who was Jewish, started touring abroad. In 1935 he travelled to Buenos Aires, where he remained for the rest of his life. He died in La Falda, Argentina, in 1978.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39ba770b44df2b76ed495324bd52f57dc79c38f6","amp;dn":"DAJOS+BELA+CD+DUPLO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39ba770b44df2b76ed495324bd52f57dc79c38f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,186,119,11,68,223,43,118,237,73,83,36,189,82,245,125,199,156,56,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
