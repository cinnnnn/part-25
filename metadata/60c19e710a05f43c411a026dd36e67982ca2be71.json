In line with Argentina's sociopolitical upheaval, the project was never completed and is now home to thousands of outcasts who live among rubble, rats, pollution, illness, crime, deadly drug lords' feuds.\nTrapero's Elefante blanco, focusing on the painstaking work of two shanty-town priests and a social worker, is a trip through urban hell. Contrary to the barrage of political harangue we are subjected to on a daily basis, Elefante blanco lays out the bare facts: a Third World country playing welfare state but in reality struggling to stay afloat. No other aborted social project could make such a visible, powerful impact as the elefante blanco, palpable proof that not everyone is given the same possibilities to attain social mobility and think ahead to a better future.\nIn such a bleak social landscape, though, there's always bound to be a group of believers and fighters. In Trapero's fiction, it's Catholic priests Julian (Ricardo Darin) and Geronimo (Jeremie Renier), plus social worker Luciana (Martina Gusman). Structured as a classic narrative, Elefante blanco is an emotional journey, starting with two gripping epigrams: a closeup of an MRI scan performed on Father Julian, and Father Geronimo escaping a massacre in the Amazon.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Elefante Blanco.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,638,905,856 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:47:19\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 696x296 (AR: 2.351)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1834 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.371 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2132324/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2132324/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpanish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nMy rip of the Argentinean DVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60c19e710a05f43c411a026dd36e67982ca2be71","amp;dn":"Pablo+Trapero+-+Elefante+Blanco+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60c19e710a05f43c411a026dd36e67982ca2be71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,193,158,113,10,5,244,60,65,26,2,109,211,110,103,152,44,162,190,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
