Two guys looking for adventure go to Aspen to work as ski instructors. Great skiing locations. Peter Berg in one of his first feature films. Also a very young William McNamara as 'skiing Santa' towards the end.\n\nGood stereo sound, widescreen. Burn tested, runs well in my divX player. 113 min.\n\nXviD 512x368 two-pass, AC3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c129c28b02da8b37daeeac1b440267ff7cfa542","amp;dn":"Aspen+Extreme+%5B1993%5D+DVDrip+%28Peter+Berg%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c129c28b02da8b37daeeac1b440267ff7cfa542","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,18,156,40,176,45,168,179,125,174,234,193,180,64,38,127,247,207,165,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
