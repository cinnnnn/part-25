Geils Band, released in 1972.\n\nThe album peaked at #54 on the Billboard album chart in North America, with the tracks &quot;Looking for a Love&quot; and &quot;Serves You Right to Suffer&quot; enjoying considerable radio airplay, thus setting up the breakthrough success of the band's next album, 1973's Bloodshot.\n\nThe album's cover depicts a poker hand, but the hand shown is not a &quot;full house&quot; as defined by the rules of the game (this is intentional; the Queen in the poker hand is winking). The title is also a play on words, referring to a packed concert venue or &quot;full house&quot; by concert promoters.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;First I Look at the Purse&quot; (Robert Rogers, Smokey Robinson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:56\n    &quot;Homework&quot; (Dave Clark, Al Perkins, Otis Rush) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:34\n    &quot;Pack Fair and Square&quot; (Walter Travis Price) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:41\n    &quot;Whammer Jammer&quot; (Juke Joint Jimmy) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:21\n    &quot;Hard Drivin' Man&quot; (J.
