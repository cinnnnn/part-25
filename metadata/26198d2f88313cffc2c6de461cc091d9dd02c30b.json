In their career, they have released more than twenty studio albums, and have charted more than twenty singles on the Billboard country charts. \n\nThis is the 2010 release from the Western Swing outfit joined by the legendary Leon Raush. It's a match made in Western Swing heaven as Ray Benson and Asleep at the Wheel team up with famed Texas Playboy Rausch for their first-ever recording together. Rausch first joined Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys in 1958, was featured in the historic 1973 recording session with Wills called For the Last Time and has gone on to lead bands such as Bob Wills' Original Texas Playboys and The Playboys II. At age 83, Rausch is one of the few Texas Playboys still performing. Asleep at the Wheel have been called 'the post-modern kings of Western Swing.\n\n\t\n \n 1. It's A Good Day (feat.
