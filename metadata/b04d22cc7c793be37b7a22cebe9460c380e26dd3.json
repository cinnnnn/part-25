First I combined the differing versions of the *.mixs from the various CDs, not knowing \n\nthat N3tRunn3r had already done that. Eventually I learned about FullRA+, and used it to finish combining the mixes, but there was still more work to be done. But there was more to do. Westwood in their \n\nvarious patches of Red Alert rarely actually replaced old files. Instead they just copied over the new versions and had them override the old ones. And it wasn't for backward compatibility either, as files \n\nsuch as the string database just added more strings where the old version left off. For neatness'sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and a few saved bytes'ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½sake, I have replaced the old version of files in the *.mixs with their newer \n\ncounterparts, and then deleted the no-longer-need &quot;override *.mixs.&quot;\n\n_______________________________________Changes_______________________________________\nCOPY TO NOTEPAD (ETC) TO READ\nHere's a pretty comprehensive list of what I have done:\n/-------------Windows DIR output--------------\\ /-----------------------------------My changes----------------------------------\\ /---------------------Original use of the *.mixs----------------------\\\n01/25/1999      211,145 wolapi.mix            &gt;
