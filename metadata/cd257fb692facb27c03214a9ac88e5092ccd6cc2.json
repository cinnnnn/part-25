The serial's production number was 421. \nThe Painted Stallion was budgeted for $102,157 but went over budget by $7007 (6.9%).

In order to maintain his power, the ruthless Official at Santa Fe must not let them arrive and he sends out his men to stop them. The wagon train then has to endure repeated attacks but is aided by a mysterious rider that shoots singing arrows and rides a painted stallion.\n\nA wagon train travelling from Independence, Missouri to Santa Fe means trouble for Alfredo Dupray, his authority from Spain will end with the arrival of a Mexican Governor. He plots to solve this by intercepting a trade agreement, to be negotiated by Clark Stuart on the wagon train, and disrupt US-Mexican relations.\n\nRepeated attacks are thwarted, however, by the appearance of a mysterious Rider on a Painted Stallion who issues warnings with her whistling arrows. With her help Clark Stuart, along with historical characters, Kit Carson, Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett work to defeat Dupray. Eventually, they assist the arrival of the US Cavalry and the treaty is signed, leaving Stuart and the Rider to ride away together.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 3:32:00\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 3:32:00","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd257fb692facb27c03214a9ac88e5092ccd6cc2","amp;dn":"The+Painted+Stallion+%281937%29+Xvid+-+Western+Serial+-+12+Chapters+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd257fb692facb27c03214a9ac88e5092ccd6cc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,37,127,182,146,250,203,39,192,50,20,169,172,136,229,9,44,205,108,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
