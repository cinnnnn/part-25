We then learn of the penchant for group sex displayed by medieval popes, the junketings of Restoration England, the aristocratic hedonists of the Hellfire Club and Scotlandâ€™s notorious Wig Club, the orgiastic tastes of Casanova and the Marquis de Sade, right into the 20th century and the bizarre excesses of Aleister Crowley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b87dff4c0866fa9f9ad8ebf16b2b7dd59cbeaf4b","amp;dn":"A+History+of+Orgies.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b87dff4c0866fa9f9ad8ebf16b2b7dd59cbeaf4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,125,255,76,8,102,250,159,154,216,235,241,107,43,125,213,156,190,175,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
