Eyewitnesses claim and the security camera confirms the killer seen leaving the building was their strange, sinister neighbor - a man who, by all reports, was already dead. \n\nCaptain Hayward leads the official homocide investigation, while Pendergast, D'Agosta, and Nora undertake a private quest for the truth. Their serpentine journey takes them into a part of Manhattan they never imagined could exist: a secretive and deadly hotbed of Obeah, the West Indian Zombii cult of sorcery and magic. And it is here they find their true peril is just beginning.\n\n\n\nGooD SeeDinG!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0df8800230e4210537e80909f26708adee42cacb","amp;dn":"Douglas+Preston+-+Lincoln+Child+-+Cemetery+Dance+-+Unb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0df8800230e4210537e80909f26708adee42cacb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,248,128,2,48,228,33,5,55,232,9,9,242,103,8,173,238,66,202,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
