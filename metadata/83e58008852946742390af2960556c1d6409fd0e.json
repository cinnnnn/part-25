Songs like &quot;Around the World&quot; revive some of the familiar vibes, while ballads like &quot;Scar Tissue,&quot; &quot;Otherside,&quot; and &quot;Road Trippin'&quot; have something extra special injected in them that makes you want to listen to them over and over... and over.. and over. ^_^ A suprising addition is &quot;Porcelain,&quot; which seems as if the guys are singing you a lullaby (awww...). It's a beautiful little diddy. &quot;Savior&quot;'s an incredible song, with tight drums, strong bass, great vocals, and fantastic guitar.\nAnthony Kiedis's unique vocals are even better than before and create the driving, flowing, upbeat frontal sound. John Frusciante's guitar sings in every essence of the word. Flea lends more valuble energy to the music, he handles the bass skillfully, and everytime I hear it's rhythms and melodies it makes me happy happy-- to the point where I want to play bass like Flea (even though I can't play the bass guitar... yet... but that isn't the point). The great thing about the Chili Peppers is their bass isn't hidden behind scores of other instruments-- it's right up front and it deserves it too. Chad Smith's percussion drives the songs. This may sound strange, but personally, I live to hear the duh-duh duh-duh duh rhythm at the beginning of &quot;Savior.&quot; It just whips the llama() ... I'm telling you. Teehee. \n\nMy recommendation is: purchase this CD. Even if you have to jack it off your friends. (One of them HAS to have it, right?) There will most likely be at least ONE song you'll absolutely love if you aren't a RHCP fan. And if you are a fan, eat the album up. Eat it ALLL up.\n\nby A Customer\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Around The World.wma                                   \n02 - Parallel Universe.wma                                  \n03 - Scar Tissue.wma                                        \n04 - Otherside.wma                                          \n05 - Get On Top.wma                                         \n06 - Californication.wma                                    \n07 - Easily.wma                                             \n08 - Porcelain.wma                                          \n09 - Emit Remmus.wma                                        \n10 - I Like Dirt.wma                                        \n11 - This Velvet Glove.wma                                  \n12 - Savior.wma                                             \n13 - Purple Stain.wma                                       \n14 - Right On Time.wma                                      \n15 - Road Trippin'.wma \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83e58008852946742390af2960556c1d6409fd0e","amp;dn":"Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers+-+Californication+%281999%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83e58008852946742390af2960556c1d6409fd0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,229,128,8,133,41,70,116,35,144,175,41,96,85,108,29,100,9,253,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
