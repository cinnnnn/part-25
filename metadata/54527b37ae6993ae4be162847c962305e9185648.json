Architects like Kevin Sloan ensure community still has a place at the heart of our urban spaces and places. We follow Kevin as he visits three of his favorite projects in the Dallas/Fort Worth area of Texas: Vitruvian Park, a landscape-driven green space; Dallas Urban Reserve, an abandoned, rubbish-strewn lot remade into a contemporary subdivision; and Airfield Falls, a water district property redesigned to showcase the area's aviation history and water-wise landscaping practices. Watch and learn how inventive design solutions like these will help define the future of modern cities.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54527b37ae6993ae4be162847c962305e9185648","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Spaces+and+Places+by+Kevin+Sloan+Studio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54527b37ae6993ae4be162847c962305e9185648","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,82,123,55,174,105,147,174,75,225,98,132,124,150,35,5,233,24,86,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
