As low and middle class wages stagnate and unemployment remains above nine per cent, Republicans and Democrats are tussling over whether to slash funding for the medical and retirement programmes that are the backbone of the US' social safety net, and whether to raise taxes - or to cut them further.\n\n\nThe budget debate and the economy are the battleground on which the 2012 presidential election race will be fought. And the US has never seemed so divided - both politically and economically.\n\n\nHow did the gap grow so wide, and so quickly? And how are the convictions, campaign contributions and charitable donations of the top one per cent impacting the other 99 per cent of Americans? Fault Lines investigates the gap between the rich and the rest.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5498ed33ceb775e7710e3732b09084c95e8bb849","amp;dn":"Fault+Lines+%7EThe+Top+1%25%7E+2011+08+Aljazeera+%28reseed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5498ed33ceb775e7710e3732b09084c95e8bb849","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,152,237,51,206,183,117,231,113,14,55,50,176,144,132,201,94,139,184,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
