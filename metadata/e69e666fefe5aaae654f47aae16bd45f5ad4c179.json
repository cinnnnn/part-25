He graduated at London University in 1964 and held junior posts at \nthe London Hospital from that time. In 1970 he joined the Hammersmith Hospital \nas a Registrar and became involved in research and development in \ngynaecological microsurgery. \n\nHe is well known today to audiences throughout the world for his several BBC \ntelevision series, which include The Human Body, Secret Life of Twins and \nSuperhuman, and through which he has shown a great capacity for communicating \noften complex science to a wide public audience. He is Professor of Fertility \nStudies at Imperial College School of Medicine, London University, and is \nworld-renowned as a fertility expert. He also heads the Department of \nReproductive Medicine at the Hammersmith Hospital in London.\n\nIn Human Instints Professor Robert Winston provides a unique insight into what \nit is that makes us human. And it is the story of our extraordinary instincts \nand why we behave the way we do and what other animals reveal about our most \nbasic drives. With intriguing experiments and secret filming he uncovers the \nsurprising science of sex. And helps us understand why one human being could \nlay down their life for another. In exploring survival, sex, competition and \nself-sacrifice, Professor Winston takes viewers on a journey of discovery into \nhuman behaviour, to look at ourselves in an entirely new way. \nHe believes the series is not science for scientists - it is about trying to \ntranslate complex ideas into something easily accessible for all. He thinks \nthe whole area of evolutionary psychology has been largely overlooked but \nthinks it&amp;#039;s fascinating. According to Winston we all carry a prehistoric \nbaggage around with us and don&amp;#039;t have full control over it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart 3:\n\nWe?re always competing, even when we least expect it. The will to win is an \ninstinct that?s kept our species alive. In this programme we discover why \ncoming out on top feels so great and why losing feels so bad.\n\nThe Joy of Victory\nFor our ancient ancestors, beating the opposition was important. It meant they \nwere more likely to survive and have children. Those who got a kick out of \nwinning were more successful and passed the desire for victory on to their \nchildren. So over generations our bodies have evolved to give us a feeling of \neuphoria when we win. \n\nA Constant Battle\nAs young children we compete for the most useful resource available - our \nparents? attention. At the University of Michigan, Brenda Volling asks parents \nto concentrate their attention on the older of two siblings. Immediately, the \nyounger children try to force their way into the game. If they fail to get \nnoticed they release a powerful and effective weapon: the temper tantrum. This \ninvariably gets them their parent&amp;#039;s attention. But when the parent plays only \nwith the younger child things are quite different. The older sibling is far \nmore likely to try to impress by following the rules, patiently waiting their \nturn, offering to help with the game, or even simply saying &quot;I love you.&quot;  One \nstudy suggests this difference in strategies continues into later life. Frank \nSulloway studied historical figures in science. \n\nSizing up the Opposition\nWe don?t have the energy or resources to compete all the time, so we have \nevolved hierarchies to avoid this. We are much more likely to feel competitive \nwith our friends and colleagues - people we feel on a par with - and therefore \nhave a realistic chance of beating. But we don?t bother to battle with those \npeople we feel are much superior, giving way to avoid a fight we would \nprobably lose. We also, unknowingly, send signals about ourselves. For men, one signal to their place in the hierarchy is in their faces. Larger, wider jaws and chins, and heavy-set brows, are the signs of a dominant face, while a submissive face looks more like that of a child.\n \nThe Agony of Defeat\nOur bodies also drive us on to win by making losing feel terrible. And we are \nmore likely to remember our losses- to help us try and avoid doing the same \nthing again. But losing is not just about feeling bad. In a hierarchical world \nreputations are very important - even more important than not losing is not \nbeing seen to be a loser. Nick Leeson discovered this to his cost. He says his \ndesire not to be unmasked as someone who had lost money led him on to take \nbigger and bigger risks- until his losses brought down Barings Bank.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe file have two audio tracks. One is english and one is chinese. The easiest \nthing is to play the file in VLC player or other player who support two \ntracks.
