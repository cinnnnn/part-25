It was released in 1983 by Passport Records. Hawkes plays all instruments (with one exceptionÃ¢â‚¬â€see below), with programmed drums and multiple layers of keyboard parts, as well as rhythm guitar. It was recorded at Syncro Sound, then The Cars's private recording studio. Tuneful and not overly experimental, it sounds (despite the instrumental nature of the material) very much like the Shake It Up era of The Cars. \n\n&quot;Jet Lag&quot; and &quot;Voyage Into Space&quot; are the only tunes to feature lyrics: &quot;Jet lag / It's a real drag&quot; and &quot;Voyage into space / Check out some other place&quot; -- sometimes processed through a vocoder. &quot;Voyage Into Space&quot; also features the artist's wife, Elaine Hawkes, on flute. \n\nHawkes would not release another solo album for 25 years. His second solo album, though also instrumental, was very different in sound than this, his first: The Beatles Uke (2005) featured Hawkes playing instrumental versions of Beatles songs on the ukelele. \n\nDenis Leary is one of the actors in this promo video.\n\nAs of this writing, Niagara Falls has yet to be released on CD.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Falls_(album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Falls_(album)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PafeEaAeh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PafeEaAeh&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 8241kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:03:55\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
