The band's most popular release, it includes the hit songs &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;, &quot;King of Pain&quot;, &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot; and &quot;Synchronicity II&quot;. Much of the material in this album was inspired by Arthur Koestler's The Roots of Coincidence, which is what the title and album's concept is based on. It was their second album to bear an English language title after their 1981 album Ghost in the Machine which was also inspired by another of Koestler's books. At the 1984 Grammy Awards the album was nominated for a total of five awards including the prestigious Album of the Year and won three. At the time of the album's release and following its immensely popular tour The Police were hailed as the &quot;Biggest Band in the World&quot;.[\n\nAll songs written by Sting, except where noted.\n1.&quot;Synchronicity I&quot; - 3:23\n2.&quot;Walking in Your Footsteps&quot; - 3:36\n3.&quot;O My God&quot; - 4:02\n4.&quot;Mother&quot; (Andy Summers) - 3:05\n5.&quot;Miss Gradenko&quot; (Stewart Copeland) - 2:00\n6.&quot;Synchronicity II&quot; - 5:02\n7.&quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; - 4:13\n8.&quot;King of Pain&quot; - 4:59\n9.&quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot; - 5:13\n10.&quot;Tea in the Sahara&quot; - 4:19\n11.&quot;Murder by Numbers&quot; (Lyrics: Sting, Music: Summers) - 4:36 (Not included on original LP release).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d9e9006c6e61f5bf8f931b5ee931e52da7bb0ba","amp;dn":"The+Police+-+Synchronicity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d9e9006c6e61f5bf8f931b5ee931e52da7bb0ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,158,144,6,198,230,31,91,248,249,49,181,238,147,30,82,218,123,176,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
