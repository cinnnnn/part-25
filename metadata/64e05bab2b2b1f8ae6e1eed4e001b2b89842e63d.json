I also really liked Slipknot's Vol. 3 album, but thought to myself: &quot;This could sound alot better.&quot; And so I decided to play around to see if I could get a different, and perhaps also better, sound out of the album.\n\n\nThis is not a remix, I have only worked on 320kbit mp3 rips of the stereo album tracks. Various processing has gone into each track, for varying purposes:\n\n\n1. Equalizing for clearing up what was initially a screaming mess of mid-frequencies. I have added both high- and low-frequency content.\n\n2. Adding content. By using exciters and harmonical processors I have sparkled up both the high frequency content aswell as the lowest frequencies.\n\n3. De-noising. Some of the tracks on the album are really distorted and sparkly, which serves it's purpose quite well though (this isn't exactly jazz). But to some extent I have actually brought that out even more when boosting higher frequencies, so some de-noising and de-crackling has been added to make things slightly less harsh.\n\n4. Transient shaping. This is the most important change. Transients are the  Some people actually think the album sounds pretty punchy, but I have gone to great lenghts to restore the punchyness to the entire audio spectrum. Along with the equalization, you can now hear and feel the bassdrum kick, and snardrums and such are quite alot more audible and less likely to be obscured by other elements (they come through alot better now). Everything seems to be positioned closer to the listener thanks to the fact that our minds perceive sounds with loud transients as coming from a source positioned quite close to us (since audiosources that are far away from us have less transient content because of the distance the soundwaves have to travel). Also, the transients themselves help give the track back some brigness in the higher frequencies.\n\n\nThe result are tracks that have less perceived loudness (RMS values have dropped since I restored peak material) but which sounds alot nicer, particularly on higher volumes where you can fully apreciate the restored frequency content and punchyness of the audio.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I decided to add 2 tracks from the Special Edition release of &quot;Vol. 3&quot; aswell. These are tracks 15 and 16. Their original bitrates were 192kbit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64e05bab2b2b1f8ae6e1eed4e001b2b89842e63d","amp;dn":"Slipknot+-+Vol.+3+%28The+Subliminal+Verses%29+Remastered+2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64e05bab2b2b1f8ae6e1eed4e001b2b89842e63d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,224,91,171,43,43,31,138,230,225,238,212,224,1,178,184,152,66,230,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
