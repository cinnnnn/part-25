Behold, a tribute to the courage and tenacity of the Israeli people!\n\nUnder the Domim Tree tells the story of various children who have suvived the holocaust, now they are at a residential school in Israel. The various things they have been through give them a sense of solidarity, but also mean hey have peculiarities of character that make getting along difficult.\n\nI have had this one for years, thus it is ripped from tape and in segmented mpg format - it plays nicely on VLC.\n\nPS My sympathy to TPB's Anakata, the $59 million man - it must be awesome to be worth that much! I wonder what Cambodia will do with the money.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bad23a99b03fa28726a59a473efff5753786e0dd","amp;dn":"Under+the+Domim+Tree+%281995%29+%D7%A2%D7%A5+%D7%94%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D+%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bad23a99b03fa28726a59a473efff5753786e0dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,210,58,153,176,63,162,135,38,165,154,71,62,255,245,117,55,134,224,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
