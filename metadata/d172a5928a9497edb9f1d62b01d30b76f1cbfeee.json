They are numbered as tracks 9 and 10 so that if you wish to have them in place as they occurred within the talk, simply change them to being Disc 1 and they will fall into their actual position.\n\n-----------\n\nWazyawatin - Calling All Defenders of the Land\n(62:11 on DVD, 50:43 my audio edit)\n\n1. intro, acknowledgements (3:45)\n2.
