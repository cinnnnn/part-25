His songwriting and his silky, polished slide technique influenced other leading Chicago blues guitarists, such as Big Bill Broonzy and Robert Nighthawk, as well as Muddy Waters, Elmore James, Mose Allison and many others. In a career spanning over 30 years he also recorded pop, R&amp;B and hokum records.\n\nIn 1928, Tampa Red became the first black musician to play a National steel-bodied resonator guitar, the loudest and showiest guitar available before amplification, acquiring one in the first year they were available. This allowed him to develop his trademark bottleneck style, playing single string runs, not block chords, which was a precursor to later blues and rock guitar soloing.[4] The National guitar he used was a gold-plated tricone, which was found in Illinois in the 1990s and later sold to the &quot;Experience Music Project&quot; in Seattle. Tampa Red was known as &quot;The Man With The Gold Guitar&quot;, and, into the 1930s, he was billed as &quot;The Guitar Wizard&quot;.\n\nTrack List\n1. You Missed A Good Man [3:30]\n2.
