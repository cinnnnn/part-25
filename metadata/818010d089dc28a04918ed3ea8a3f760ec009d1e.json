This book sets out to fill this gap by means of a sustained debate between two philosophers, William Lane Craig and Quentin Smith, who defend opposing positions. Craig argues that the Big Bang that began the universe was created by God, while Smith argues that the Big Bang has no cause. Alternating chapters by the two philosophers criticize and attempt to refute preceding arguments. Their arguments are based on Einstein's theory of relativity and include a discussion of the new quantum cosmology recently developed by Stephen Hawking and popularized in A Brief History of Time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:818010d089dc28a04918ed3ea8a3f760ec009d1e","amp;dn":"William+Lane+Craig+%26amp%3B+Quentin+Smith+-+Theism%2C+Atheism+and+Big","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"818010d089dc28a04918ed3ea8a3f760ec009d1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,128,16,208,137,220,40,160,73,24,237,62,168,163,247,96,236,0,157,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
