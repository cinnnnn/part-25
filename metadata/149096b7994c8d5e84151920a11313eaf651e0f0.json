Through the eyes of key people--Jacob Lew, White House director of the Office of Management and Budget; Douglas Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office; Blackstone founder and former Commerce Secretary Pete Peterson; and more--Wessel gives readers an inside look at the making of our unsustainable budget.\n\n\n\n                           Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                           Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n          **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n            Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:149096b7994c8d5e84151920a11313eaf651e0f0","amp;dn":"Red+Ink+by+David+Wessel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"149096b7994c8d5e84151920a11313eaf651e0f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,144,150,183,153,76,141,94,132,21,25,32,161,19,19,234,246,81,224,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
