Frankie was an American actor, singer, playwright, and former teen idol.As a teenager he played with Bobby Rydell in Rocco and the Saints.  Avalon had 31 charted U.S. Billboard singles from 1958 to late 1962, including &quot;Just Ask Your Heart&quot; (U.S. #7), &quot;I'll Wait For You&quot; (U.S. #15), &quot;Bobby Sox to Stockings&quot; (U.S. #8), and &quot;A Boy Without a Girl&quot; (U.S. #10).

It was released as a double b-side with &quot;Almost Grown&quot; in 1959.        \n        Following in the footsteps of his older brother, the legendary Frankie Lymon, Lewis Lymon also made an attempt at rock &amp; roll stardom. And though his group, the Teenchords, never enjoyed the level of success achieved by Frankie's Teenagers, they still carved out a significant niche for themselves in the ranks of 1950s rock &amp; roll vocal groups.The group consisted of Lewis Lymon (lead), Ralph Vaughan (first tenor), Rossilio Rocca (second tenor), Lyndon Harold (baritone), and David Little (bass).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdf2b52967edc5c317f9533015e45ffa4f8601e5","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+365","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdf2b52967edc5c317f9533015e45ffa4f8601e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,242,181,41,103,237,197,195,23,249,83,48,21,228,95,250,79,134,1,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
