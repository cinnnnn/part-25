As subject matter went, I wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t pulling any punches ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ we were breezing through material I wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think of introducing to most groups of adults. At one point, a boy raised his hand to\nask a question, and I noticed he looked younger than most of the others. Squinting, I read a logo on his T-shirt that told me he was in elementary school. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re in sixth grade?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ I asked, a little stunned. These kids were motoring, after all. The boy didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even look up. He shook his head, doubleclicked something, and mumbled, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThird.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He was 8 years old.\n\nSketchUp was invented back in 1999 by a couple of 3D industry veterans (or refugees, depending on your perspective) to make it easier for people to see their ideas in three dimensions. That was it, really ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they just wanted to make a piece of software that anyone could use to build 3D models. What I saw in Arkansas makes me think they were successful.\n\nBefore it was acquired in 2006 by Google, SketchUp cost $495 a copy, and it was already a mainstay of architectsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and other designersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ software toolkits. No other 3D modeler was as easy to understand as SketchUp, meaning that even senior folks (many of whom thought their CD/DVD trays were cup holders) started picking it up. These days, SketchUp is being used at home, in school, and at work by anyone with a need to represent 3D information the way itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s meant to be represented: in 3D. Google SketchUp (as itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s now called) is available as a free download in six languages, and is just as popular internationally as it is in North America.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e84d98c17dd9f21951f9630ca2e95f29215576bf","amp;dn":"Google+SketchUp+For+Dummies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e84d98c17dd9f21951f9630ca2e95f29215576bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,77,152,193,125,217,242,25,81,249,99,12,162,233,95,41,33,85,118,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
