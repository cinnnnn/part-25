A number of epistemological\nperspectives of social theory and methodology are examined in order to\ndevelop operational strategies suitable for the particular possibilities and\nconstraints of the archaeological record. It is suggested that social practice,\ni.e. structurative performance, is a suitable object of study as it mediates\nmacro theory of social formations and micro theory of individual identity and\nmotivation. The work departs from a social constructionist standpoint,\npointing out the possible different constitution of prehistoric social\nformations as being temporally distant from contemporary formations. It is\nargued that the probable existence of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“extinctÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, unknown social practices\nimplies that traditional anthropological and sociological theory and method\nare not sufficient for archaeological studies. Prehistoric social formations\nhave to be considered on their own terms rather than interpreted through\ncross-cultural analogies with contemporary societies. Hence the operational\nstrategies suggested here focus on, and seek to increase, the available\nsocial information that can be extracted from the archaeological record,\nincluding aspects of the local environment. It is proposed that a\nmicroarchaeology of locales, i.e. specific analysis of the structurative\nprocesses of a smaller time-space sector, is a promising approach to\ninterpret structurating principles and properties of prehistoric social\nformations. The constitution of the social subject and initiation of social\npractices are also discussed from various perspectives, including corporeal\nand psychological aspects.\n\nKey-words: social theory, social identity, social practice, materialities,\ncorporealism, constructionism, landscape.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d8678b28e0fff7c3f86829f666f76b6e51c48fa","amp;dn":"Archaeology+as+science-fiction+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d8678b28e0fff7c3f86829f666f76b6e51c48fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,134,120,178,142,15,255,124,63,134,130,159,102,111,118,182,229,28,72,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
