He is an award-winning novelist, poet, and playwright, and his novels have been translated into twenty-five languages. SjÃƒÂ³n is the president of the Icelandic PEN Centre and the chairman of the board of Reykjavik UNESCO City of Literature. Also a lyricist, he has written songs for BjÃƒÂ¶rk, including for her most recent project, Biophilia, and was nominated for an Oscar for the  lyrics he co-wrote (with Lars von Trier) for Dancer in the Dark. He lives in Reykjavik. \n\nThe Icelandic writer SjÃƒÂ³n, whose international breakthrough came with his novel The Blue Fox, is a renaissance man. SjÃƒÂ³n started his career as a poet at age 15, and took part in ReykjavikÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cultural explosion in the 1980s when Ã¢â‚¬Å“there was no hierarchy in the arts.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ SjÃƒÂ³nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inspiration has always come from melding ancient Icelandic traditions with the avant-garde. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I go into pockets of Icelandic history . . . I love to bring diverse cosmologies alive on the page. I mix myths and crackpot theories together with my need to tell a story.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* From the Mouth of the Whale, Translated from the Icelandic by Victoria Cribb (Telegram Books)\n\n* The Blue Fox, Translated from the Icelandic by Victoria Cribb (Telegram Books)\n\n* The Whispering Muse, Translated from the Icelandic by Victoria Cribb (Telegram Books)\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/books/icelandic-author-surrenders--completely-to-mercy-of-stories-279655202.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/books/icelandic-author-surrenders--completely-to-mercy-of-stories-279655202.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thewhitereview.org/interviews/interview-with-sjon/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thewhitereview.org/interviews/interview-with-sjon/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://publishingperspectives.com/2011/10/icelandic-author-sjon-on-myths-and-crackpot-theories/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://publishingperspectives.com/2011/10/icelandic-author-sjon-on-myths-and-crackpot-theories/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e344708fd1956b7ad15e8a45df9cb24400a92cc8","amp;dn":"Sjon+-++Icelandic+Author+%283+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e344708fd1956b7ad15e8a45df9cb24400a92cc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,68,112,143,209,149,107,122,209,94,138,69,223,156,178,68,0,169,44,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
