These interconnect so that such common concepts as 'trust' in someone and 'care taking' include both ideas of emotional and financial support. State policies on security rest on perceptions of two other institutions, the family and insurance, both of which are subject to change. At one time the extended family was seen as a major security-providing institution, but the contemporary nuclear family is more fragile. The concept of insurance originally entailed ideas of community and mutual aid; however, the institution has developed, in its modern private form, as a profit-driven entity. This book addresses various uses of state power in providing security for citizens and explores different ways in which this can be done in accordance with particular ideas of justice and the role of the state.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2f0e4ff45d23c392012e7f528cba266ae40568d","amp;dn":"Carol+Weisbrod+-+Grounding+Security+Family%2C+Insurance+And+the+St","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2f0e4ff45d23c392012e7f528cba266ae40568d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,240,228,255,69,210,60,57,32,18,231,245,40,203,162,102,174,64,86,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
