When they were teenagers, their sister was abducted and murdered, and their devastated family never recovered. Now Adam keeps to himself, scraping by as a bail bondsman, working so close to the town's criminal fringes that he sometimes seems a part of them.\n\nKent Austin is the beloved coach of the local high school football team, a religious man and hero in the community. After years of near misses, Kent's team has a shot at the state championship, a welcome point of pride in a town that has had its share of hardships.\n\nJust before playoffs begin, the town and the team are thrown into shock when horrifically, impossibly, another teenage girl is found murdered. When details emerge that connect the crime to the Austin brothers, the two are forced to unite to stop a killer-and to confront their buried rage and grief before history repeats itself again.\n\nMichael Koryta, long hailed as one of the best young thriller writers at work today, has written his greatest novel ever-an emotionally harrowing, unstoppably suspenseful novel that proves why Michael Connelly has named him &quot;one of the best of the best.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7186109/Michael_Koryta_(ePub__Mobi__Full_Retail)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7186109/Michael_Koryta_(ePub__Mobi__Full_Retail)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf7e33610b3cd6a19e4c05315a7e6dd6017a9671","amp;dn":"The+Prophet+by+Michael+Koryta+%28ePub+and+mobi+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf7e33610b3cd6a19e4c05315a7e6dd6017a9671","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,126,51,97,11,60,214,161,158,76,5,49,90,126,109,214,1,122,150,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
