Arturia, in partnership with Bob Moog, have \n        made  it possible with a faithful reproduction of one of the most \n        famous series of synthesizers: Moog Modular. \n                  \n                  \n        Endless synthesis \n        ***************** \n                  \n        Because  it  is  modular,  the  Moog  Modular  V  offers  endless \n        possibilities  for  synthesis.  9  oscillators, 3 filter slots, 2 \n        LFOs,  6 envelopes, VCAs, mixers, triggers, a 3x8 step-sequencer, \n        etc.  With  such  an  instrument,  you  can  make  all  types  of \n        combinations  and  create  sounds  that  were never heard before. \n                  \n                  \n        Pure analog \n        *********** \n                  \n        TAE ,  standing  for  True  Analog Emulation, is a new technology \n        developed  by  Arturia,  enabling  the  digital  reproduction  of \n        analog  circuits.  The  implementation  of  TAE in Moog Modular V \n        results in: \n                  \n                  \n        - aliasing-free oscillators, at no extra CPU cost. \n                  \n        -  better  reproduction  of  analog  oscillators: the condensers&amp;#039; \n          unload  and the oscillators&amp;#039; instability are simulated, helping \n          to reproduce a typical warm sound. \n                  \n        -  very  accurate  reproduction  of  the  legendary  Moog  24  dB \n          low-pass filter. \n                  \n        -  implementation  of  soft  clipping,  i.e.  reproduction of the \n          filters&amp;#039; current limiting function. \n                  \n                  \n                  \n        What&amp;#039;s new in Moog Modular V2 \n        ----------------------------- \n                  \n                  \n        New ergonomics: \n        *************** \n                  \n        -  One  unique  scrollable  view  to  overlook  the entire synth. \n                  \n        -  Some  of  the  modules  are  now  interchangeable, allowing to \n          configure  - to a certain extent - the Modular the desired way. \n                  \n        New audio possibilities: \n        ************************ \n                  \n        -  Improvements  on  the  oscillators  (new free running), on the \n          filters  (better  response  to  modulations),  on the envelopes \n          (faster   and   even  closer  to  true  analogical  behaviour). \n                  \n        - New Unison mode \n                  \n        - New Audio-In possibilities \n                  \n        -  The  Soft-clipping emulation is now done on each mixer and not \n          systematically  on  all  of  them,  which  saves  on  CPU load. \n                  \n        New modules: \n        ************ \n                  \n        -  1630  Bode Frequency Shifter. Developed under the Moog license \n          by  Harold  Bode  in  1964,  it  is  extremely  rare  (a  dozen \n          Worldwide). \n                  \n        -  928 Sample and hold is also very rare. Originally assembled in \n          a  separate cabinet, it was adapted on the last modular series, \n          in the late 70&amp;#039;s. \n                  \n        -  912  Envelope  follower  (or  Schmit Trigger). One of the most \n          popular  modules  on  the  Moog  systems, it was often added to \n          original  configuration  to  create  complex modulation through \n          the use of an output signal. \n                  \n        -  12 stage phaser. The Moog 12 Stage Phaser was very well known, \n          and  originally  conceived  as  an external rack to the Modular \n          systems. \n                  \n        -  Formant  Filter.  A new module developed by Arturia, which did \n          not   exist  on  the  original  Moog  systems.  It  allows  the \n          filtering  of  sounds  according to the formants a, e, i, o, u. \n                  \n        -  Ring  Modulator.  Also  a  new module developed by Arturia, it \n          creates \n                  \n                  \n        New presets \n        *********** \n                  \n        200  new  presets  to  provide  optimal  use  of  the new modules \n                  \n                  \n        more info available at : \n                  \n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.arturia.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.arturia.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80a7773cdb90d31dad24ae514b9dda9cef265897","amp;dn":"Arturia+Moog+Modular+ISO+Plus+2.2+Update+and+Keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80a7773cdb90d31dad24ae514b9dda9cef265897","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,167,119,60,219,144,211,29,173,36,174,81,75,157,218,156,239,38,88,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
