Bullock\n2010 \nEnglish\nISBN: 143983766X\n369 Pages\nPDF\n4.25 MB\n\n\n Each year, disasters such as house fires, car accidents, tsunamis, earthquakes, and hurricanes impact hundreds of thousands of children. Child victims can suffer disproportionately and the physical and psychological damage sustained can far outweigh the same effects in adults, often requiring years of therapy. Sadly, emergency planners to date have largely failed to adequately recognize and accommodate the particular requirements of children in times of disaster.\n\n\n Identify Needs\n\n Highlighting the infrastructure that supports children in a safe and secure community, Managing Children in Disasters begins by identifying the special needs of children, including physical security, emotional stability, family unity, and ongoing education. It looks at how hazard mitigation actions can reduce the long- term impact of a disaster on this infrastructure, and outlines the many steps that can be taken by parents, emergency managers, school officials, and child care providers to prepare for a future incident.\n\n \n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f06d213b64f30e5be25952615c95aa1075bfaaeb","amp;dn":"Managing+Children+in+Disasters%3A+Planning+for+Their+Unique+Needs+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f06d213b64f30e5be25952615c95aa1075bfaaeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,109,33,59,100,243,14,91,226,89,82,97,92,149,170,16,117,191,170,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
