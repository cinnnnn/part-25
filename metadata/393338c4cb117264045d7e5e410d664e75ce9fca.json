His only possession is a book at his side: Walden, by Henry David Thoreau. He decides to take the name Henry David, shortened to Ã¢â‚¬Å“HankÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Jack, a street kid who befriends him. Shortly after they meet, Jack and Hank are involved in a crime with a kid-exploiting criminal called Magpie. Afraid to approach the authorities for help, Hank flees to Concord, Massachusetts, hoping that WaldenÃ¢â‚¬â€œboth the book and the locationÃ¢â‚¬â€œwill offer clues to his identity. That first night, Hank sleeps outdoors at the site of ThoreauÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cabin, then seeks shelter in the local high school and the public library. A tattooed, motorcycle-riding librarian/Thoreau historian named Thomas takes Hank under his wing, and guides him on the painful path to discovering his true identity. When Hank can run no further from the truth, will he confront the tragedy of his life or seek the ultimate escape?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:393338c4cb117264045d7e5e410d664e75ce9fca","amp;dn":"Being+Henry+David+-+Cal+Armistead.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"393338c4cb117264045d7e5e410d664e75ce9fca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,51,56,196,203,17,114,100,4,93,126,94,65,13,102,78,117,206,159,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
