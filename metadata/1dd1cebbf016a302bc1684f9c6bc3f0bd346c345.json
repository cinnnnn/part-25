In this wartime adventure, his cast of characters is caught up with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Disciplinary Regiment,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a tank regiment that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t actually have a tank to its name. Consisting of a bunch of hardened killers dressed in filthy rags and stinking to high heaven, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re engaged in fighting a brutal battle against the Russians. Then suddenly the orders change: theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re sent to Hamburg, where their next assignment will be guard duty for the bestial Gestapo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dd1cebbf016a302bc1684f9c6bc3f0bd346c345","amp;dn":"Assignment+Gestapo+-+Hassel+Sven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dd1cebbf016a302bc1684f9c6bc3f0bd346c345","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,209,206,187,240,22,163,2,188,22,132,249,198,188,63,11,211,70,195,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
