It is implied that the title of the manga is derived from the &quot;good endings&quot; that are achieved in harem visual novels. Although the story was once concluded in the one shot version, the full version includes identical characters and settings.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad74f5c27a50bf10c75ed731c0e4cb50dce8a834","amp;dn":"GE%3A+Good+Ending+-+Vol.+10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad74f5c27a50bf10c75ed731c0e4cb50dce8a834","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,116,245,194,122,80,191,16,199,94,215,49,192,228,203,80,220,232,168,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
