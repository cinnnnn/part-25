Only one third of the material has appeared on CD before.[/color][/quote]\n\n[quote][color=deepskyblue]The Hamsters are a band from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England.\nThey performed their first live show at the Cliffs Pavilion, Southend-on-Sea, on 1 April 1987. They initially played in local pubs with no ambitions to take themselves seriously or to turn professional. As the band ethos is to combine humour with music two members of the original band (now all three) use light-hearted and parodying pseudonyms as stage names. The original line-up was Snail's-Pace Slim on vocals and guitar, Rev Otis Elevator on drums and Andy Farrell on bass. Andy Billups, aka Ms Zsa Zsa Poltergeist, replaced Farrell on bass in 1988.\nThe band's name was based on a pseudonym used by the Sex Pistols\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n1.
