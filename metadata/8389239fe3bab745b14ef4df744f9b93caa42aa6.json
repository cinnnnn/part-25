Released from prison, hoping to rebuild his life, ex-con Jimmy Rose has been beaten up attempting to rescue his drug-addicted granddaughter Ellie. \n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/09/07/480f6b06f0e718e899e22486dd4c3fc4.jpg[/img]\n\nAfter being rushed to hospital, Jimmy calls Roy and does a runner. Parked outside Ã¢â‚¬ËœPizza ThisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ they see the owner, Mehmet Guzman, standing with Tony Chivers. Jimmy is outraged Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœUglyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Tony added four years to JimmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sentence for attacking a security guard on the raid they were sent down for. Roy has to warn Jimmy that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no good to his family back in prison, or laid out on a slab.\n \nJackie and Sue are door-stepped by a DS Steve Macintyre and DC Fraser about JimmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s injuries and whereabouts. Jackie covers for Jimmy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ again Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but is hurt, vulnerable and furious that Jimmy cannot and will not change. Jimmy agrees to give her some space and is confronted by Tony at the DIY store. He warns Jimmy to stay away from Mehmet Guzman.\n \nWhile Jimmy is keeping vigil outside EllieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flat, two men torch JackieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s car. Police take a statement from Jackie and DS Steve Macintyre turns up. He tells Jackie heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s missed her and she falls into his armsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. Meanwhile, Jimmy learns about the arson attack from his probation officer, who is concerned that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to no good.  Jimmy rushes home to find Steve who makes his excuses and leaves. Jimmy tends to JackieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s injuries while explaining Ugly TonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involvement. Jackie confesses she had an affair while he was inside. Jimmy is dumbstruck and walks out on her.   Jimmy goes to find out what Roy knows\n \nAt Roy and SueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, Sue gloats Ã¢â‚¬â€œ after all those years on her own, no wonder Jackie found someone else. Jimmy snaps and ploughs into the back of her car before breaking down in tears with clueless Roy.\n \nJimmy returns to EllieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flat and is surprised when she comes running to him for help. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had a visit from Tony and two heavies wanting payment for the heroin Jimmy threw away. Jimmy doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have Ã‚Â£20K to bail them out but if AaronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disappeared EllieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not safe to go back to the flat.\n \nJimmy takes Ellie to JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house who refuses to let a drug addict near his young family, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s overruled by wife, Maria. Jackie turns up in support of Jimmy but he ignores her heartfelt thanks. \n \nJimmy follows Tony into a carpark lift. Warning him to stay away from his family Jimmy lobs a lit Molotov cocktail, which terrifies Tony before realising it is only water. JimmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s overstepped the mark.\n \nJimmy shows up and stays at JulieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house. She is pleased to have her dad back. Meanwhile Joe takes his frustrations out on Jackie, guessing that Steve is her lover. Maria enters and exclaims that Ellie has gone.\n \nJimmy leaves work to look for Ellie. He and Jackie find her holed up in the flat, with a heavily beaten up Aaron. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s payback for the lift incident. Jimmy accepts responsibility for Aaron too when Ellie insists they come as a pair. This debt isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to go away easily.\n \nJimmy and Roy try old firm contacts to get the money for EllieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debt but to no avail. Jimmy has no choice but to fall on the mercy of his son. He sees Joe and Mehmet chatting at the gates of JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s school, clearly friends. Jimmy follows Mehmet and tells him to call off Tony. Mehmet plays dumb.\n \nJimmy tries to warn Joe about Mehmet, but he wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t listen - Mehmet is a school governor and an upstanding businessmen. He sticks it to Jimmy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ presumably mum told him about the policeman?\n \nSteve goes to see Jackie. They find Jimmy in the kitchen. Devastated Jimmy tells Jackie to start divorce proceedings and leaves. Steve reassures Jackie that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re free to be together, but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not convinced.\n \nJimmy meets Tony and tells him he will take on Aaron and EllieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã‚Â£20K debt. Tony wants to know if heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got the money?  No says Jimmy; heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done with being a good boy. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll pay it off by working for Tony","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8389239fe3bab745b14ef4df744f9b93caa42aa6","amp;dn":"The.Trials.of.Jimmy.Rose.s01e02.EN.SUB.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8389239fe3bab745b14ef4df744f9b93caa42aa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,137,35,159,227,186,183,69,177,78,244,223,116,79,155,147,202,164,42,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
