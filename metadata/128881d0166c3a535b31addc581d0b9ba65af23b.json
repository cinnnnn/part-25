Ã¢â€žâ€” 1978 CBS Records. \n\nJeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds is a 1978 concept album by \nJeff Wayne, retelling the story of The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells. Its format \nis progressive rock and string orchestra, using narration and leitmotifs to carry \nthe story via rhyming melodic lyrics that express the feelings of the various \ncharacters. The two-disc album remains a bestseller, having sold millions of \nrecords around the world,[1] and is the 38th best selling album of all time in the \nUK with sales of 2,561,286 by 2009.[3][4] It has since spawned multiple versions of \nthe album, video games, DVDs, and live tours.\nIn a prologue, the Journalist prepares to recount the experiences he had in the \nlate 19th century. He notes that few had even considered the possibility of alien \nlife, but that they were observed across space by advanced beings who regarded \nEarth with envy.\n\nIn the Journalist's story, several masses of green gas erupt from Mars. For the \nnext ten nights, they continue towards Earth. Ogilvy the astronomer assures the \nJournalist there is no danger, convinced that no life could exist on Mars. The \nfirst missile lands in Horsell Common. In a sand pit, Ogilvy discovers a glowing \ncylinder whose top begins unscrewing. A crowd gathers, drawn by the spectacle. \nThe cylinder lid falls off, and a Martian creature emerges. Several men move \ncloser, but are incinerated by the Heat-RayÃ¢â‚¬â€œan advanced Martian weapon. The \nJournalist flees with the crowd. Hammering sounds are heard from the pit: the \nMartians are constructing machines. A company of soldiers is deployed at the common.\nLater, an Artilleryman arrives at the Journalist's house, telling him that his \ncomrades were killed by Martian fighting-machinesÃ¢â‚¬â€œtripod vehicles armed with Heat-\nRays. They set off for LondonÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe Journalist to ensure his lover Carrie is safe, \nand the Artilleryman to report to headquartersÃ¢â‚¬â€œbut are separated when caught in the \ncrossfire between soldiers and fighting-machines. Three days later, the Journalist \narrives at Carrie's house to find it empty. Depressed, he attempts to escape London \nby boat. He sees that Carrie has boarded a steamer ship, but the gangplank is \nraised before they can reach each other. Fighting-machines approach the steamer, \nbut the ironclad Thunder Child attacks them. The steamer escapes, but Thunder Child \nis destroyedÃ¢â‚¬â€œhumanity's last hope of victory is lost.\n\nThe Earth Under the Martians\n\nThe next day, the wandering Journalist finds that red weedÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe vegetation giving \nMars its colourÃ¢â‚¬â€œhas taken root on Earth, rapidly overgrowing the landscape. In a \nchurchyard, he encounters the Parson Nathaniel and his wife Beth. Delirious, \nNathaniel believes the invaders are not Martian creatures, but demons arising from \nhuman evil. The trio take refuge in a nearby cottage, where they are trapped by \nblack smokeÃ¢â‚¬â€œa Martian chemical weapon. Nathaniel despairs, blaming himself for the \ninvasion. Beth attempts to restore his faith in humanity. A Martian cylinder lands \non the cottage, killing Beth. The Martians outside construct a handling-machine: \na squat spider-like vehicle used to collect humans. After nine days hiding in the \nruined cottage, the Journalist and Nathaniel see the Martians &quot;feeding&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€œharvesting \nhuman blood and injecting it into their own veins. Nathaniel resolves to confront \nthe &quot;demons&quot;, believing himself chosen to destroy them with his prayers and holy \ncross. The Journalist knocks him unconscious to protect them both. Hearing the \nnoise, the Martians send a mechanical claw to explore the cottage. It drags away \nNathaniel's unconscious body, but the Journalist evades detection. Later, finding \nthat the Martians have disappeared, the Journalist leaves. On his way back to \nLondon, he encounters the Artilleryman once more. The Artilleryman shares his plan \nto start a utopian civilisation, located underground, where humans can evade the \nMartians, and ultimately strike back with reverse-engineered Martian technology. \nThe Journalist leaves, realising the Artilleryman's ambitions far exceed his \nabilities. He reaches London, finding it desolate and empty. Driven to the point \nof suicide by his own loneliness and the city's silence, the Journalist surrenders \nto the Martians, but finds the fighting-machines lifeless. The Martians were killed \nby Earth's bacteria, to which they had no immunity: from the moment they arrived \nand fed, they were doomed.\n\nIn an epilogue, the Journalist concludes his story: humanity recovered from the \ninvasion, and he was reunited with Carrie. The Journalist wonders if Earth is safe,\nor if the Martians have learned from their failure and are preparing a second \ninvasion. In the modern day, a NASA mission to Mars encounters trouble when the \ncontrol centre loses contact with the craft. The controller sights a green flare \nerupting from Mars's surface.\n\nCast\nRichard Burton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ spoken words (The Journalist: the narrator-protagonist)\nDavid Essex Ã¢â‚¬â€œ spoken words and vocals (The Artilleryman)\nPhil Lynott Ã¢â‚¬â€œ spoken words and vocals (Parson Nathaniel)\nJulie Covington Ã¢â‚¬â€œ spoken words and vocals (Beth)\nJustin Hayward Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals (The Sung Thoughts of the Journalist, including: \n&quot;Forever Autumn&quot;)\nChris Thompson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals (The Voice of Humanity: &quot;Thunder Child&quot;)\nJerry Wayne Ã¢â‚¬â€œ spoken words (&quot;Epilogue, Part 2&quot;)\nKen &quot;Prof&quot; Freeman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards\nChris Spedding Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars\nJo Partridge Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars (mainly The Heat Ray), mandolin\nGeorge Fenton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ santur, zither, tar\nHerbie Flowers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\nBarry Morgan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\nBarry da Souza, Roy Jones, Ray Cooper Ã¢â‚¬â€œ percussion\nPaul Vigrass, Gary Osborne, Billy Lawrie Ã¢â‚¬â€œ backing vocals\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:128881d0166c3a535b31addc581d0b9ba65af23b","amp;dn":"1978+Jeff+Wayne+++%26lrm%3B%26ndash%3B+Jeff+Wayne%27s+Musical+Version+Of+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"128881d0166c3a535b31addc581d0b9ba65af23b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,136,129,208,22,108,58,83,91,49,173,220,88,29,11,155,166,90,242,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
