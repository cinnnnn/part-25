Jazz, blues, rock and roll, gospel, salsa, samba, funk, hip-hop, reggae, zydeco, zoukÃƒï¿½the list of genres which have roots in African music is endless. Africa is home to a myriad of styles, and it remains one of the most creative places for music on the planet. \nTradition still plays an important role in today&amp;#039;s African music, yet increasingly influences from around the world are making themselves heard. Ironically, many of the foreign music styles that have been most influential on today&amp;#039;s African music have African origins. They are merely long lost relatives returning home. You will hear echoes of jazz, reggae, hip- hop, funk and salsa in the songs included on this collection. \nOnce you have listened to Africa we hope you are inspired to explore further the richness and variety of African music. \n\nTracklist:\nOliver Mtukudzi - Ndima Ndapedza \nSoul Brothers - Thandaza \nAfia Mala - Segne \nJohnny Clegg &amp; Juluka - Love is Just a Dream \n4 Etoiles - Doly \nSamba Ngo - Sa Ntima \nHabib KoitÃƒÂ© - Wassiye \nOom - Anoma \nDiaou Kouyate - Gafale \nHenri Dikongue - Francoise \nSam Mangwana - Ya Mbemba \nRicardo Lemvo &amp; Makina Loca - Manuela\n\n\n\nThis is one of the many PutumayoÃ‚Â´s records I have in mind to upload, so please help keep seeding after you downloaded.\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:947e29da4091e990bcc9792d4caad8b439014e97","amp;dn":"Putumayo+Presents-Africa+by+Ulysses56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"947e29da4091e990bcc9792d4caad8b439014e97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,126,41,218,64,145,233,144,188,201,121,45,76,170,216,180,57,1,78,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
