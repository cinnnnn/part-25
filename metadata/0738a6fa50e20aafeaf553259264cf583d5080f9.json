A good multivitamin is a MUST, and a B12 and Potassium supplement will help speed up weight loss. (I recommend once every 2 days take 1000 mcg of B12, and take a multivitamin everyday as well as a potassium  supplement).\n\nThe Weight Loss Program (Taken directly from DrBDiet.com)\n\n\nWith our program we can stimulate the body to break down fat faster than normal , releasing stored energy and food value that the body uses at the rate of up to Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¾ lbs of fat per day. The program involves a unique combination of a low calorie diet of regular grocery store foods, behavior modification counseling, education and vitamin and mineral supplements. We require you to come in at least 3 times a week to be monitored by nurses and doctors who check your progress and health. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no guesswork involved.\n\nMost importantly, the regimens ensure that you lose only fatty tissue. Unlike other diets - you will never lose essential muscle tissue, vital proteins, electrolytes and bodily fluids. Our patients lose fat tissue that has mainly been stored in such problem areas as the waist, hips and thighs.\n\nThe most dramatic feature of the Dr. Bernstein program is the rate of weight loss. For example, taking off 80 pounds on a traditional low calorie diet usually takes at least a year. And only 3% who try ever actually succeed - most people give up long before that year lapses due to frustrating problems like hunger, cravings, headaches, and fatigue. Dr. BernsteinÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Diet prevents those problems so you have a far, far greater expectation of success - and can easily lose 80 pounds in 4 - 5 months. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a typical result without exercise.\n\nRest assured, we use no diet pills, appetite suppressants or any unproven or risky procedures. You will learn a great deal about nutrition and your bodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s needs so you can control your weight and stay slim for life. On the first day of The Diet, you will already feel good about starting the program, and in a week or two youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to feel absolutely great!\nThe Maintenance Program\nDr. BernsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Maintenance Program is designed for your specific metabolism and is essential to your ongoing success. It will teach you to eat sensibly and normally for the rest of your life - without worrying about exceeding your healthy goal weight.\n\nMaintenance is really what losing weight is all about. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a lifestyle change, not just a diet or diet mentality. In fact, Dr. Bernstein stresses that The Maintenance Program is more an educational process than anything else. Rebound weight gain will not happen when you lose weight properly and we intend to show you how easy it is. &quot;When you first come to our clinic, you already know how to eat too much. During the dieting period, you learn how to eat too little; and now with Maintenance, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll show you how to eat just enough.&quot;\n\nOver 75% of our patients keep their new slim weight. This is an astounding statistic compared to the 5% success rate of other diet programs worldwide. And itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an easier process than you might think.\nHere are 10 key benefits about our Maintenance Program:\nFACT #1 When youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve reached your goal, you can stay there for life. We will arm you with the knowledge and techniques to be able to keep the excess weight off permanently. You wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t experience rebound weight gain (medical term: recidivism).\n\nFACT #2 Eat what you like and stop worrying about dieting all the time. Maintenance signifies that moderation prevails - your really strict dieting days are over. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been replaced with a plentiful and delicious menu of healthy and wholesome foods.\n\nFACT #3 Expect to live an extra 10 years or so. Maintaining your goal weight is critical in preventing stroke, heart attacks, hypertension and certain forms of cancer. A healthy weight means a lowered pulse rate, cleaner arteries and veins, and improved cholesterol levels and blood sugar (thus reducing or eliminating fatigue and food cravings).\n\nFACT #4 Cravings are gone. Cravings are created by an unbalanced diet and unstable blood sugar levels. By learning how to eat sensibly - cravings and abnormal hunger are a non-issue.\n\nFACT #5 Finally - be the object of someone elseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fantasies. You may find some very pleasant side effects of maintaining your weight, particularly regarding romance, sexuality and emotional involvement. Medically speaking, these side effects include cleaner veins and arteries and improved blood supply that help many patients with improved sexual function and general well-being well into old age.\n\nFACT #6 Enjoy shopping for clothes again. Really. Those troublesome inches around the thighs, buttocks and waist will stay off. And as you continue your new way of caring for your body, you will find it allows you to consider fashions that you previously thought we not meant for you.\n\nFACT #7 YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll look younger. So many of Dr. BernsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s patients who have lost 25 to 40 pounds routinely hear they look 10 years younger. You can look forward to years of good skin tone that is notably healthy and retains its elasticity.\n\nFACT #8 YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have energy to do things you never thought possible. Maintenance takes into account a full and exciting life that requires lots of energy and places no limits on sporting and physical activity. Your ongoing food intake contains all the protein and nutrients that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll ever need.\n\nFACT #9 Your career prospects look as good as you do. It has been said that the decision to hire a new employee is made in the first sixty seconds of a job interview. A trim personal appearance signifies self-control and confidence and can have positive influences on your future. The answer of course, is being in the best physical shape possible and maintaining it throughout your career.\n\nFACT #10 WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll always be here for you. Come in or call whenever you feel the need.\nThe Mechanics of the Maintenance Program\nThe Maintenance Program, more than anything, is an educational process, and with education and understanding, comes success.\n\n    * We recommend that most patients stay on Maintenance for at least a year.\n    * The process involves reintroducing foods to find out how many calories you can actually burn - and not gain weight. EverybodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s calorie requirements will be a little different.\n    * For the first week or two, Maintenance starts with just a little more food in general. In time, we find what particular foods cause you to gain weight. It doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mean you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t ever eat that food. But you will have to change your portions and preparation methods.\n    * People metabolize different foods differently. Too many carbohydrates may be the cause of your weight gain. Other people may not be able to metabolize dairy fats efficiently. We determine which foods work for you and which ones trigger weight gain.\n    * Of course, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re probably anxious to try some foods not previously allowed on the original Dr. Bernstein Diet: pasta, different meats or dairy products. You can now have more variety, of course in careful, measured portions.\n    * YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll still come in to the clinic at least once a week and keep the daily food diary sheets, recording everything you eat, and continue taking vitamins as directed. We then assess and fine-tune your food intake.\n\nDr.BÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Tune-Up Diet\nThe Tune-Up Diet is a special program for a sensitive situation. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about getting as healthy as you deserve to be so that you can fully enjoy life, not to mention to look as good as you can.\n\nOur medically supervised diet programs have an excellent long-term success rate. But sometimes even the best patients have let good habits and healthy bodies take a back seat to careers, stressful lifestyles, and convenient fast foods. As a result they sometimes find themselves having gained an extra 5 to 15 pounds - but they should never feel too embarrassed to call the clinic. A few extra pounds is never a reason to panic. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re here to help. We want you to feel comfortable about coming in. But make no mistake about it - weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d much rather take off those 5 or 15 pounds now (and that irritating inch or two off your waistline) than 20 or 40 pounds later on.\n\nYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not on your own and weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll take care of it in a matter of weeks. The Tune-Up Diet works beautifully.\n\nPerhaps you have a family reunion, a wedding, a special someone in your life - or youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d just like to feel better physically and emotionally for yourself. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d definitely like to take those nagging extra pounds and lose them forever. Well, forever is right now. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really what this Tune-Up program is all about. Of course, since your treatment at The Bernstein Clinics is 100% medically supervised, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll know exactly how losing that extra weight impacts on your overall health. Even the relatively small reduction of 10 to 15 pounds. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not easy on your own. It calls for one-to-one personal medical supervision and support. The weight wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t go away by itself. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve done it together before and we can do it again.\n\nEven if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never had a previous weight problem, 5 or 15 pounds can still turn into 20, 40, 60 or more. Or worse, you may harm your body or experience ill effects if you try to treat it yourself\n\n\nThe Tune-Up Techniques\n\nThe most important fact about The Tune-Up Diet is that the fundamental techniques of the main diet work just as well for losing small amounts of weight; especially in the fight against irritating recidivism: the yo-yo effect of losing weight and then gaining it back. Dr. Bernstein has found that the long-term success rate on these patients was just as remarkable as with his more severe cases. But in only 7 to 21 days you will have reached your goal, a wonderfully short, manageable period of time.\n\nAlso, years of clinical observation have shown that in the case of very overweight people, the first 10 to 15 pounds they lose arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t all that noticeable. The last 10 or 15 are astonishing. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also one of the best features of the Tune-Up program. Since you only have a little to lose, you will see a marked difference virtually every day.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s your own reward and will inspire you to stick to the diet for the required time. It will help you regain control of your life. It will give you back your favourite jeans or T-shirt. Or you can wear whatever you want that shows off every bit of you. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll feel and look absolutely great.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0738a6fa50e20aafeaf553259264cf583d5080f9","amp;dn":"Dr.+Bernstein+Diet+Cookbook+%26+Guidelines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0738a6fa50e20aafeaf553259264cf583d5080f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,56,166,250,80,226,10,175,234,245,83,37,146,100,207,88,61,80,128,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
