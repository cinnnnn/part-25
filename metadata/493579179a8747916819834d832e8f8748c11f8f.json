So when the deceased is discovered to be a police officer, Gene and Alex are ordered to keep the case under wraps.\n\nPC Sean Irvine was supposed to be clearing the streets of vice, but did he instead become seduced by it? When the pathologist uncovers signs that Sean was murdered, the team need to discover whether he was killed because he was a corrupt cop, or because he was an honest one.\n\nAs the case leads them onto dangerous territory, Alex finds herself kidnapped by a man whose words threaten her whole perspective on this world. Only Gene can save her, but even if he gets there in time, Alex fears that someone else in 1982 knows her dark secret: that she is from the future.\n\nMeanwhile, sounds and messages from that future suggest to Alex that her circumstances have changed. Lying with a bullet in her head on the wet ground of an abandoned boat, is it possible that someone has discovered her?\n\nAspect Ratio: 720 x 576 : 16:9 Anamorphic Widescreen\n\nVideo: H.264 High Profile : 1000kbps 25fps : 2 Pass Encoded\n\nAudio: AAC-LC 48000Hz 128kbps ABR Stereo\n\nMD5 Checksum: 709ECE4FAB3BDD1D200AD6F43699707A\n\n[Frank_UK]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:493579179a8747916819834d832e8f8748c11f8f","amp;dn":"Ashes+to+Ashes+S02E01+%5BBBC+One%5D+%5BH.264%5D+%5BFrank_UK%5D.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"493579179a8747916819834d832e8f8748c11f8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,53,121,23,154,135,71,145,104,25,131,77,131,46,143,135,72,193,31,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
