From the very end of the song and sung a bit more intensely.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:794fbe248cf595d7338324812cf5c2efe6e0c7b3","amp;dn":"Metallica+-+Master+Tracks+-+Extracts+from+Fuel+vocal+track","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"794fbe248cf595d7338324812cf5c2efe6e0c7b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,79,190,36,140,245,149,215,51,131,36,129,44,245,194,239,230,224,199,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
