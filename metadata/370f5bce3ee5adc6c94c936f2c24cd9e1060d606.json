Yep, this is the one that, started it all off, and I wouldn&amp;#039;t exactly say with that much to shout about. Granted, it&amp;#039;s by no means a bad compilation, but subsequent later volumes were much better, and this doesn&amp;#039;t really epitomize the whole &amp;#039;skate rock&amp;#039; sound. It&amp;#039;s mostly filled pretty typical California sounding punk (again, not a bad thing), but it doesn&amp;#039;t get me all fired up and wanting to shred. Standouts include such obvious choices as the Faction, The Big Boys, J.F.A., and Riot .303 is pretty decent too.\n    -ERIK SN\n\n\nTHRASHER SKATE ROCK vol. 2: BLAZING WHEELS AND BARKING TRUCKS LP/tape\nLabel: High Speed Productions\nReleased: 1984\n\n1.

DRUNK INJUNS &quot;She Gots a Gun&quot;\n\t\n\n    Reviews:\n\n    Great tape right here for all you skaters out there. A definite improvement over the first one. Like the first tape, it really has a California feel to it, and i think most the bands on it are from Cali anyway. I like that a lot about these tapes. McRad, J.F.A., Big Boys, Borscht, and the Faction all step up big time here. Pretty good all the way through with only a few exceptions. Definitely worth your time.\n    -ERIK SN\n\n\nTHRASHER SKATE ROCK vol. 3: WILD RIDERS OF BOARDS tape\nLabel: High Speed Productions\nReleased: 1985\n\n1. SLAM &quot;Wild Riders of Boards&quot;\n2.

GANG GREEN &quot;Skate To Hell&quot;\n\t\n\n    Reviews:\n\n    This is an incredible compilation all around. I think you can tell that just by looking at what bands are on it. COC when they were still good, Christ On Parade, Accused, Beyond Possession, and Septic Death all contribute great cuts. Slam, the Boneless Ones, and No Rules tracks are all mediocre, while Gang Green never should have regrouped, but overall this is one of the best volumes in the series. The only downside to this volume is the complete and total lack of information on it such as who compiled it, bands contact addresses, and other shit. There&amp;#039;s virtually no information given on it except the track listing. Still, this comp is awesome. Pick it up.\n    -Erik SN\n\n\nTHRASHER SKATE ROCK vol. 4: SMASH tape\nLabel: High Speed Productions\nReleased: 1986\n\n1. SKATE MASTER TATE &quot;Skaterock Rap&quot;\n2.

SCREAMIN&amp;#039; SIRENS &quot;Heartbreak Train&quot;\n\t\n\n    Reviews:\n\n    Now, see, sometimes the people who compiled these comps had the bright idea to keep it interesting and mix it up a little by putting bands on it that aren&amp;#039;t just hardcore punk. Most volumes are not just strictly hardcore punk, which is cool by me, but this is one of the volumes that contains a lot of other styles. I think this was a big mistake. Granted, Skate Master Tate is pretty cool, but he&amp;#039;s not featured on this one. FUCK. The only band on here really worth listening to is McShred who contribute two tracks of nice crossover style hardcore. One of the other main problems that plaged these comps was the lack of info given in the insert or just plain shitty packaging overall, and this volume exemplifies that. Definitely seek out other volumes before getting this one.\n    -Erik SN\n\n\nTHRASHER SKATE ROCK vol. 5: BORN TO SKATE tape\nLabel: High Speed Productions\nReleased: 1987\n\n1.

BEOWULF &quot;Hussy&quot;\n19. DEHUMANIZERS &quot;Halfpipe&quot;\n20. SCREAMIN&amp;#039; LORD &amp; HIS HEAVY FRIENDS &quot;Kings Of Trash&quot;\n\t\n\n    Reviews:\n\n    First off, I&amp;#039;d just like to note the packaging on this volume as it is one of the only two volumes which comes with contact info for every band on it-ÃƒÂ¢??awesome! &quot;Born To Skate&quot; is just another great installment in the series although some stuff is annoying such as Racer X-AZ, Eight Days A Week, and Screamin&amp;#039; Lord Salba &amp; His Heavy Friends. Aside from those three though, this comp RAGES. Lots of great West Coast crossover on this volume including Condemned Attitude? (who have members of Attitude Adjustment; perhaps this band is a collaboration between guys from Condemned and Attitude Adjustment?), No Mercy, Excel, and the Dehumanizers. Other standouts include the Stupids, D.I.&amp;#039;s, J.F.A. (although not their best material), S.N.F.U., and Beowulf. Another mandatory listen in the Thrasher Skate Rock series. It&amp;#039;s still kind of funny thinking about how the Thrasher Skateboard Magazine that we all know today could ever have put out such an amazing series of compilations.\n    -Erik SN\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:370f5bce3ee5adc6c94c936f2c24cd9e1060d606","amp;dn":"Thrasher+Magazines+Skate+Rock+Volumes+1+through+5%2C+as+I+found+th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"370f5bce3ee5adc6c94c936f2c24cd9e1060d606","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,15,91,206,62,229,173,198,201,76,147,111,44,36,205,158,16,96,214,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
