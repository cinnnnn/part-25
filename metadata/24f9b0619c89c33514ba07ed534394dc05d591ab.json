At the last second, Zabuza is seemingly killed by a young masked hunter ninja from the Hidden Mist Village. Naruto is angry and jealous that someone so young could easily defeat an opponent that gave Team 7 so much trouble, but Kakashi says that there are many ninja younger than Naruto yet stronger than himself. The hunter-nin leaves with Zabuza's body, and Kakashi then collapses from fatigue as a result of using his Sharingan for too long.
