So, after waking from an alcoholic blackout to discover his tractor stuck in a ditch and the body of a teenage girl in the cottonwood grove bordering his cornfield, things look worryingly familiar. \nWith no alibi and a creeping suspicion that he might indeed be guilty, Dexter decides to investigate the crime himself. He canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell anybody. Not his friend, the sheriff, who keeps offering to help him winch his tractor out of the ditch. Nor his estranged wife, whose love heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s desperate to win back. And certainly not the Tollivers, his redneck neighbors.\nFortunately, DexterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not entirely alone. He has some help. \nIn the shape of the dead girl herself.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b516f6ce2bacf78ad864b3f0ca649014f62fb1f9","amp;dn":"The+Grove-+John+Rector%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b516f6ce2bacf78ad864b3f0ca649014f62fb1f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,22,246,206,43,172,247,138,216,100,179,240,202,100,144,20,246,47,177,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
