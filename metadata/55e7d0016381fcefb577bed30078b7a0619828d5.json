One night in the pharmacy, Wesley is told by a mysterious woman named Fox that his father was a recently murdered assassin, and the killer, Cross, is after him. Cross and Fox engage in a shoot-out followed by a car chase in the streets of Chicago. Wesley manages to escape and Fox then has a shoot out again with Cross, causing a car accident that knocks Wesley unconscious. Fox brings Gibson to the headquarters of The Fraternity, a thousand-year-old secret society of assassins. The group's leader, Sloan, explains that Wesley's panic attacks are actually the untrained expression of a rare superhuman ability; when stressed, the drastically increased heart rate and adrenaline levels result in bursts of superhuman strength, speed, and reflexes. They make him shoot the wings off a fly and it proves he does have superhuman abilities. The Fraternity can teach him to control this ability, so Wesley can follow in his father's footsteps as an assassin, beginning by inheriting his fortune. Wesley is initially reluctant and returns to work, only to finally snap when discovering several million dollars in his bank account. He excoriates his boss in front of the entire office, and on his way out, hits Barry in the face with a computer keyboard. Fox is waiting outside to take him back to the Fraternity headquartersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an unassuming textile mill.\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Thriller\n\nRelease date: 25 June 2008 (UK)\n\ncast\n\nAngelina Jolie\nJames McAvoy\nMorgan Freeman\nCommon\nThomas Kretschmann\nKonstantin Khabensky\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name: Wanted 2008 720p BRrip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1938.15 MiB\nDuration: 1h 50mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 463 Kbps\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 114 r1924 08d04a4\nAverage video bitrate: [/b]\n[b]Frame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/89039283756804831809.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/89039283756804831809.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/09122910547141070378.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/09122910547141070378.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/62682631847101022102.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/62682631847101022102.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/99896705043177659741.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/99896705043177659741.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/45675735258350608059.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/45675735258350608059.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/22236444092884432923.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/22236444092884432923.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/59981862745207509365.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/59981862745207509365.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/19254573707701355355.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/19254573707701355355.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFollow us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55e7d0016381fcefb577bed30078b7a0619828d5","amp;dn":"Wanted+2008+720p+BRrip+x264+aac+vice+%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55e7d0016381fcefb577bed30078b7a0619828d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,231,208,1,99,129,252,239,181,119,190,211,0,120,183,160,97,152,40,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
