You might even be concerned that someone you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know is connected to your network this very minute.\n\nThe problem is you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see a wireless network. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t touch it. And you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know who is connected to it without some help.\n\nBut there is a way to be 100% certain that no one is on your Wireless Network but the computers and devices that you want to be on itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nHow secure is your Internal Network?\n\nCompanies spend tens of thousands of dollars each year trying to keep out the bad guys. From deploying firewalls and intrusion prevention systems, to hosted antivirus and proxy servers. One often overlooked aspect of network security is that as computers connect over wireless networks or through physical space that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t controlled.\n\nThere is an opportunity for hackers and malware to completely bypass all external network security and plug directly into the network.\n\nAnd what about employees that decide to bring in their own computers onto the network? You mightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve locked down every computer that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve deployed to your employees, but what about the home laptop with malware installed on it. Have you protected against that?\n\nSometimes the most dangerous person on a network is Bob from accounting.\n\nWho Is On My Wifi will tell you exactly which computers are on your network during the day. This gives those concerned with Internal Security of the Corporate LAN a leg up on keeping out viruses and potential attackers. Who Is On My Wifi canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be blocked by personal firewalls on computers that have connected to your lan and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to wait until theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve connected through Active Directory. It works at the hardware level so\n\nWho Is On My Wifi will find all computers on your network, even if they havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t connected to the Domain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b64e762ed3425ae3e607c6739d7697fa12a63c6d","amp;dn":"Who+Is+On+My+Wifi+2.0.4+portable+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b64e762ed3425ae3e607c6739d7697fa12a63c6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,78,118,46,211,66,90,227,230,7,198,115,157,118,151,250,18,166,60,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
