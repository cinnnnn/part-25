It was numbered 13 on VH1&amp;#039;s &quot;Top 40 Greatest Metal Songs.&quot; It is one of Dio&amp;#039;s most popular songs.\n\nDio has said in a 2005 interview that he was displeased with the song, considering it to sound too much like pop music. He said that after the recording was finished he took a razor blade and declared his intention to destroy the tape. However, the other members of the band talked him out of it.\n\nIn a VH1 documentary, Dio also stated that the lyrics reflected his feelings after leaving Black Sabbath, as he felt alone and rejected, hence a &quot;Rainbow in the Dark&quot;. It should also be noted that the title may refer to Dio&amp;#039;s other band, Rainbow.\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d94cae100848094136f602f25381e55f4f5ca486","amp;dn":"Dio+-+Rainbow+In+The+Dark","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d94cae100848094136f602f25381e55f4f5ca486","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,76,174,16,8,72,9,65,54,246,2,242,83,129,229,95,79,92,164,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
