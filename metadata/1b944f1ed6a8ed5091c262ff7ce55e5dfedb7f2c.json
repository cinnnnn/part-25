But it's trouble right from the start, when problems with their hog during transit may force them to withdraw from the whole hog competition. While Brooke and the Shed team scramble to pick up a new hog, Mama discovers the plates for the judging portion are broken, so it's up to the Shed Pimps to scour the local antique stores for a replacement. It might be Daddy-O's secret recipe beef skewers to the rescue, as Brad, Hobson and Scotty struggle to overcome a mine field of obstacles and make the finals in whole hog.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 02-Sep-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b944f1ed6a8ed5091c262ff7ce55e5dfedb7f2c","amp;dn":"The.Shed.S01E06.HDTV.x264-OMiCRON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b944f1ed6a8ed5091c262ff7ce55e5dfedb7f2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,148,79,30,214,168,237,80,145,194,98,255,124,229,94,93,254,219,127,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
