For children of the 80s it was the initial introduction \nto Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, The Foundations all those ancient \nsoul men.\n \nIt was the first time a generation came close to understanding the \nromance of singer Kevin Rowlands Irish precursor, Van Morrison.\n \nIt was (and is) an album to die for, with its crystal-bright horn \nsound and the way it spoke with words that left no room for doubters\non songs such as &quot;There, There, My Dear&quot; (a letter to wannabe hipsters\nset to music), &quot;Keep It&quot; and the triumphant &quot;Dance Stance&quot;. \n\nThe albums Number One single &quot;Geno&quot;a shout-out to the UK 60s soul \njourneyman Geno Washington was pure inspiration. \n\nWhen Dexys appeared on Top Of The Pops to celebrate the songs ascent,\nthey were all Mod-sharpness and mirror-bright brass. \n\nSEARCHING FOR THE YOUNG SOUL REBELS captures the original eight-piece \ngroup infusing passionate self-belief into songs based on 60s mentors \nGeno Washington and Jimmy James. \n\nRowlands expressive voice is perfectly matched by pumping horns and punchy\nrhythms, But the intensity of their performance ensures the set never falls \ninto pastiche. \n\nEach song bears the stamp of a manifesto, one that was largely Rowlands, \na myopic vision that brought this line-up to an acrimonious, premature end. \n\nHis commitment, however, ensured the lasting qualities of this album. \n\n__________\n\n \n1.
