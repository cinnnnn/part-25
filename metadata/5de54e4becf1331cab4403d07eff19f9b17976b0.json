Few politicians have been as praised, condemned, honored and vilified as James Earl Carter, Jr. Some even call him a hypocritical opportunist who sacrifices principles for expediency and who has hoodwinked people by his personal charm and professions of honesty, love and godliness. Now, one of America's top investigative reporters looks behind the myths that surround the peanut farmer from Plains, Georgia. Gary Allen's acidic biography is a wonderful antidote to the fairytales spread by the mainstream media. Inside, you will find the details of Carter's life before he was a virgin. Allen writes with a venemous wit and there's something delightfully cathartic in reading his sarcastic take on the 39th US President. Find out who this Jimmy Carter really is. 85 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5de54e4becf1331cab4403d07eff19f9b17976b0","amp;dn":"Allen-Jimmy+Carter%2CJimmy+Carter%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5de54e4becf1331cab4403d07eff19f9b17976b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,229,78,75,236,241,51,28,171,68,3,208,126,255,25,249,177,121,118,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
