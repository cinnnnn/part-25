They, along with Natalie Maines, make up the Dixie Chicks. The sisters decided to record a side project under a different name. Court Yard Hounds, featuring Robison for the first time as lead vocalist released a debut album for Columbia Records, the same label for which the Dixie Chicks has recorded, on May 4, 2010. The album debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 chart, initially selling 61,000 copies. It has sold approximately 825,000 copies in the United States.\n\nAmelita is the second studio album by Country band Court Yard Hounds. It was released in July 2013 under Columbia Records.  (wikipedia)\n\nThe sisters tackle a variety of subjects and sounds on the diverse country-pop album. The title track has a lighthearted ease, while 'Phoebe,' an eerie ballad based on a tragic suicide that the sisters read about, has an appropriately stressed overtone. Robison sings lead on most songs and Maguire co-wrote the majority; however, Maguire sings lead on 'Guy Like You.' The lead single on the album, 'Sunshine,' is a sarcastically titled song about a narcissistic acquaintance. (rollingstone.com)\n\n- - -\n\nCourt Yard Hounds - Amelita 2013\n(Columbia)\n\n 1.
