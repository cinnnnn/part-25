Derived from words like possible, positive, poetry and\nhypothesis, Po is a language indicator to show that the process of provocation\nis being used to move from a fixed set of ideas in an attempt to discover new\nones. Po Music represents ideas as provocation rather than as an accurate\ndescription of what things are: a positive, possible, poetic hypothesis.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Joe McPhee\n\nReviews\n~~~~~~~ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/oleo-r143757&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/oleo-r143757&lt;/a&gt;\nby Brian Olewnick\n\nFans of Joe McPhee were no doubt surprised to hear a tight reading of Sonny\nRollins' &quot;Oleo&quot; burst forth on the opening track and perhaps surprised yet again\nwhen, after stating the theme, Raymond Boni's wah-wah guitar suddenly sprawled\nover the proceedings. But McPhee was ever the adventurer and Oleo was a\nstatement of sorts, signaling his reluctance to be pigeonholed into one area of\nthe avant-garde. &quot;Oleo&quot; is followed with a suite dedicated to three Pablos --\nPicasso, Casals, and Neruda -- and features bassist Francois Mechali in\nSpanish-tinged mode, providing a lovely arco lead-in for the ensemble. The\nentire piece is a thing of restrained beauty. Much of the remainder of the album\nalso features McPhee coming face to face with &quot;the tradition,&quot; either\nexplicitly, as in his cover of Benny Golson's &quot;I Remember Clifford,&quot; or in the\nrelatively straightforward thematic material of his own pieces. There's even the\noccasional injection of a trace of funk! Special mention should be made of reed\nplayer Andrew Jaume, a longtime associate of McPhee's, who is outstanding here,\nespecially on tracks like the gorgeous &quot;Astral Spirits,&quot; a deep, touching paean\nto the Ayler brothers. Oleo was released on disc along with a solo recording of\nMcPhee's under the title of Oleo &amp; A Future Retrospective\n\n\nBy Clifford Allen &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=15104&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=15104&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Derek Taylor &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bagatellen.com/archives/reviews/000637.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bagatellen.com/archives/reviews/000637.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f2f29432da3dd276e137298be374aad20ea4302","amp;dn":"Joe+McPhee+Po+Music+-+Oleo+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f2f29432da3dd276e137298be374aad20ea4302","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,47,41,67,45,163,221,39,110,19,114,152,190,55,74,173,32,234,67,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
