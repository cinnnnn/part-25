Despite new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's promise of economic revitalization, investor optimism about the future, and plenty of potential, Japanization reveals why things are unlikely to change any time soon.\n\nPesek argues that &quot;Abenomics,&quot; as the new policies are popularly referred to, is nothing more than a dressed-up version of the same old fiscal and monetary policies that have left Japan with crippling debt, interest rates at zero, and constant deflation. He explores the ten forces that are stunting Japan's growth and offers prescriptions for fixing each one.\n\nOffers a skeptical counterpoint to the popular rosy narrative on the economic outlook for Japan\nGives investors practical and detailed insight on the real condition of Japan's economy\nReveals ten factors stunting Japan's growth and why they are unlikely to be solved any time soon\nExplains why most of what readers believe they know about Japan's economy is wrong\nIncludes case studies of some of the biggest Japanese companies, including Olympus, Japan Airlines, Sony, and Toyota, among others\nFor many investors, businesspeople, and economists, Japan's long economic struggle is difficult to comprehend, particularly given the economic advantages it appears to have over its neighbors. Japanization offers a ground-level look at why its problems continue and what it can do to change course.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17f4e7e7a5cb0f0226b7a61b6efe5519f3069a3b","amp;dn":"Japanization+-+What+the+World+Can+Learn+from+Japan%27s+Lost+Decade","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17f4e7e7a5cb0f0226b7a61b6efe5519f3069a3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,244,231,231,165,203,15,2,38,183,166,27,110,254,85,25,243,6,154,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
