With songs by Robert Johnson, Willie Dixon, Jimmy Rogers, Hank Williams, LightninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Hopkins and Jimmy Reed, the collection is a soulful tour de force for Dion, not only in his familiar role as a magnificently interpretive vocalist but, also, as a brilliantly innovative guitarist.\n\nDion notes, &quot;When I was a kid, there was no Rock &amp; Roll. In the early 50Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬â€œ late at night, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d tune into Wheeling, West Virginia (WWVA), listening to the Blues Ã¢â‚¬â€œ HowlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ WolfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœHow Many More Years,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Jimmy ReedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœBright Lights, Big City.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ After school, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d run home to catch the last half hour of the Ã¢â‚¬ËœDon Larkin Country ShowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ coming out of Newark. I was a Hank Williams junkie; for me, putting country and blues together Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what I call Rock &amp; Roll.&quot;\n\nPreviewing the album in MOJO, Paul DÃƒÂ©chamÃƒÂ© writes, &quot;Recalling the back-to-basics approach of CashÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s American recordings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ muted drums, acoustic guitars Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a little like having Dion in your front room strumming his favourite blues songs.&quot; Don McCleese, in No Depression, sums up Bronx In Blue thusly: &quot;It all sounds like Dion. It all sounds great.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfc2ce9ce682cfeeac40b6c2ee58d23cc63bc694","amp;dn":"Dion+-+Bronx+In+Blue+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfc2ce9ce682cfeeac40b6c2ee58d23cc63bc694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,194,206,156,230,130,207,238,172,64,182,194,238,88,210,60,198,59,198,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
