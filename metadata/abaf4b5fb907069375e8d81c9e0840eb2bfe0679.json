Stranger In My Arms\n\nPlaying Time.........: 28:19\n\nThis is in many ways a typical George Strait album of the eighties but it finds George in a particularly relaxed \nmood - almost as if he's trying to tempt a few Don Williams fans to buy the album.\n\nI really think though that the singles are the best songs of the cd and they were wisely chosen. \nAll 3 singles stayed at #1 on the country billboard charts back then for then 5 weeks each. \nThese were some of his biggest singles ever. \nThe other 7 songs are good but are very dry though and alot of the nonsingles are missing emotion. \nBut livin it up is a great record by george.\n\nThe album yielded two number one country hits (Love without end amen, I've come to expect it from you), both original \nsongs, and a country top five hit (Drinking Champagne), which was a cover of a song originally recorded by Cal Smith. \nGeorge recorded two songs (Someone had to teach you, She loves me she don't love you) with his road band. \nThe other tracks including the hits were recorded with studio musicians - however, the album flows seamlessly and \nif you didn't read the credits (or this review) you probably wouldn't realize that different musicians were used. \nThere are plenty of other wonderful songs here including Lonesome rodeo cowboy, We're supposed to do that now and then, \nWhen you're a man on your own and Stranger in my arms.\n\nThis is a very enjoyable George Strait album. It probably isn't the place to begin a George Strait collection \n(unless you're also a Don Williams fan) but it definitely deserves a place in such a collection.\n\n\nA FrankFoo Original Rip\n\n\nMultiTracker @ FrankFoo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abaf4b5fb907069375e8d81c9e0840eb2bfe0679","amp;dn":"George+Strait+-+Livin%27+It+Up+%28Flac%29+%5BFrankFoo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abaf4b5fb907069375e8d81c9e0840eb2bfe0679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,175,75,95,185,7,6,147,117,232,216,28,158,8,64,235,43,254,6,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
