This box set may not \n\nappeal to listeners who already own all four discs, since there are no new liners or \n\nbonuses, but anyone who's about to invest in the set should consider this, since it \n\noffers all four at a savings. And if you get one, you'll probably want to get all \n\nfour, so this is a good way to get 'em all at once.\n\n\n\n######---\n\nFor you Drica :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6d37b256ee8257e986c569ef635c49f128dc410","amp;dn":"Blue+Note+-+Blue+Break+Beats+volumes+1-4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6d37b256ee8257e986c569ef635c49f128dc410","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,211,123,37,110,232,37,126,152,108,86,158,246,53,196,159,18,141,196,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
