The song was released as a 45rpm single on September 24, 1957, to coincide with the release of Presley's motion picture, Jailhouse Rock.\n\nThe song as recorded by Elvis Presley is #67 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and was named one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\n\nThe single, with its B-side &quot;Treat Me Nice,&quot; was a US #1 hit for seven weeks in the fall of 1957, and a UK #1 hit for three weeks early in 1958. In addition, &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; spent one week at the top of the US country charts, and reached the No. 2 position on the R&amp;B chart.\n\nSome of the characters named in the song are real people. Shifty Henry was a well-known L.A. musician, not a criminal. The Purple Gang was a real mob. &quot;Sad Sack&quot; was a U.S. Army nickname in World War II for a loser, which also became the name of a popular comic strip and comic book character.\n\nGender studies say that the song is also known for &quot;its famous reference to homoerotics behind bars&quot;. Indeed, according to Garry Mulholland, &quot; 'Jailhouse Rock' was always a queer lyric, in both senses. 'Number 47 said to number 3/You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see/I sure would be delighted with your company/Come on and do the jailhouse rock with me.' &quot; According to Rolling Stone, Leiber and Stoller's &quot;theme song for Presley's third movie was decidedly silly, the kind of tongue-in-cheek goof they had come up with for The Coasters. The King, however, sang it as straight rock &amp; roll, overlooking the jokes in the lyrics (like the suggestion of gay romance when inmate Number 47 tells Number 3, 'You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see') and then introducing Scotty Moore's guitar solo with a cry so intense that the take almost collapses.&quot; Douglas Brode thinks it &quot;amazing that the sequence passed by the censors&quot;.\n\nIn 2005, the song was re-released in the UK and reached No. 1 for a single week. The song, which is an example of simple verse form, eventually received an additional double-platinum certification from the RIAA in 1992, representing shipments of two million copies of the single.\n\n\nElvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ August 16, 1977) was an American singer, musician, and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as &quot;the King of Rock and Roll&quot;, or simply, &quot;the King&quot;.\n\nBorn in Tupelo, Mississippi, Presley and his family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, when he started to work with Sam Phillips, the owner of Sun Records. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who was to manage the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, released in January 1956, was a number-one hit in the US. He became the leading figure of rock and roll after a series of network television appearances and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement, made him enormously popularÃ¢â‚¬â€and controversial.\n\nPresley is one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres, including pop, blues and gospel, he is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music, with estimated album sales of around 600 million units worldwide. He was nominated for 14 Grammys and won three, receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jailhouse_Rock_(song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jailhouse_Rock_(song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jailhouse_Rock_(film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jailhouse_Rock_(film)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaofeAaFn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaofeAaFn&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8000kbps\n   Audio1: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\n   Audio2: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 384kbps\n   Duration: 00:01:47\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
