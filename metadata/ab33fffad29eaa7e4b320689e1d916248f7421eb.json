It only works with Linux. \n\n~Using It~\n\n*If you don&amp;#039;t have Linux, download Damn Small Linux or Ubuntu, and install it within VirtualBox then install TrueCrypt inside of the Linux Distro*\n\n\nTrueCrypt tries to invoke &quot;truecrypt -p *password* *truecrypt-file*&quot; and TrueCrypt in Windows it does not work like that.\n \nI recommend making a temporary TrueCrypt file and a temporary password file just to try CrackTC out and get a hang of how it works, so you&amp;#039;re sure you&amp;#039;re doing it right when trying to find the correct password for your &quot;real&quot; volume. See the examples folder for this.\n\nExample: java CrackTC myVolume.tc passwords.txt\n\npasswords.txt should be like:\n\npassword1\npassword2\npassword3\npassword4\npassword5\netc...\n\nPlease note that the TrueCrypt volume must be dismounted!\n\nUsually that is:\n\ntruecrypt -d /dev/mapper/truecrypt0 \n\n~Generate Passwords~\n\nTo generate passwords I used Password Generator Professional 2007. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kristanixsoftware.com/passwordgenerator/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kristanixsoftware.com/passwordgenerator/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt was great for me since this program has a &quot;masking mode&quot; (i.e. you can say that, for example, the first letter must be a selection of some specific letters, and that the second only can be a number, and so on. So if you know stuff like that, you can minimize the combinations considerably).\n\n~Notes~\n\nNote that the app is incredibly slow. On an Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2880MHz, it tries about 4.1 passwords per second. On an AMD XP 2800+, 2.5 passwords / second. \nSo if you&amp;#039;ve got billions of different possible combinations it will take a LONG time. \n\nWhen I made this program, the password I had lost wasn&amp;#039;t entirely lost. I didn&amp;#039;t know exactly how it was, just approximately. So from that knowledge, I could generate about 40,000 possible combinations, and CrackTC found my password within an hour (though it could have taken longer).\n\nThis torrent is only for CrackTC and does not include a password generator, TrueCrypt, VirtualBox, or any Linux Distros.\n\nCheers,\n~ZOiT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab33fffad29eaa7e4b320689e1d916248f7421eb","amp;dn":"CrackTC+-+Crack+TrueCrypt+Passwords+%7E+Team+ZOiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab33fffad29eaa7e4b320689e1d916248f7421eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,51,255,250,210,158,170,126,75,50,6,137,225,217,22,36,143,116,33,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
