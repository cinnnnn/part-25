(I suggest www.daemon-tools.cc/)\n\nIn the Hellfire.rar is a folder which also includes something called &quot;The Hell&quot; (here for more info www.moddb.com/mods/diablo-the-hell) \n\nYou should have no problems running the Hellfire.exe while you've got the Diablo.iso mounted, and so should be able to enjoy :D\n\nDownload, seed, and enjoy! :D\n\nP.S.
