What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88c6842aa4a9d181f669c5ad26da487cc097d085","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+Mar+27+SA+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88c6842aa4a9d181f669c5ad26da487cc097d085","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,198,132,42,164,169,209,129,246,105,197,173,38,218,72,124,192,151,208,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
