Against all odds, one visionary African leader and a group of dedicated scientists defied the conventional wisdom that insists oil and logging are the only way to bring prosperity to an impoverished land.\n\n Out of the wild they created 13 new national parks - and are now developing an eco-tourism industry to sustain them. Gabon: The Last Eden tells this amazing story with stunning footage - silverback gorillas defending territory, mandrill baboons faces splashed with day-glow color, and hippos wallowing in the ocean - exploring one of the planet's last true wildernesses and what is being done to save it.\n\n\n\nNARRATED BY: Glenn Close\n-------------------------\n\n\nYear:  2007\nFile Size: 347 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:44:48\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 608x336\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1058 kbit/s\nFPS:  23.976000\nAudio Bitrate: 129 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2\nSubtitles: (N/A)\n\n  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1204050/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1204050/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor father information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db4d40688d2d7622c9a1789f5426ce3b428cb6e0","amp;dn":"Gabon+The+Last+Eden-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db4d40688d2d7622c9a1789f5426ce3b428cb6e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,77,64,104,141,45,118,34,201,161,120,159,84,38,206,59,66,140,182,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
