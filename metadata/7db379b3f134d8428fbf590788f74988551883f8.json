Amsden\n\n\nPublisher:   Oxford University Press, USA\nNumber Of Pages:   416\nPublication Date:   2001-01-18\nISBN-10 / ASIN:   0195139690\nISBN-13 / EAN:   9780195139693\nBinding:   Hardcover\n\n\nProduct Description: \nAfter World War II a select number of countries outside Japan and the West--those that Alice Amsden calls &quot;the rest&quot;--gained market share in modern industries and altered global competition. By 2000, a great divide had developed within &quot;the rest&quot;, the lines drawn according to prewar manufacturing experience and equality in income distribution. China, India, Korea and Taiwan had built their own national manufacturing enterprises that were investing heavily in R&amp;D. Their developmental states had transformed themselves into champions of science and technology. By contrast, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico had experienced a wave of acquisitions and mergers that left even more of their leading enterprises controlled by multinational firms. The developmental states of Mexico and Turkey had become hand-tied by membership in NAFTA and the European Union. Which model of late industrialization will prevail, the &quot;independent&quot; or the &quot;integrationist,&quot; is a question that challenges the twenty-first century.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7db379b3f134d8428fbf590788f74988551883f8","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2001%5D+The+Rise+of+The+Rest+Challenges+to+the+West+from+La","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7db379b3f134d8428fbf590788f74988551883f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,179,121,179,241,52,216,66,143,191,89,7,136,247,73,136,85,24,131,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
