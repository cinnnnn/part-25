He doesn't take sides so much as report the facts - and the death tolls. Thus the American Civil War finds its way into White's 100, regardless of whether its nearly 700,000 deaths (soldiers and civilians combined) can be justified as the price for preserving the Union and freeing slaves.\n\nWith its unrelenting focus on horribleness, the book might best be used as a reference work, and it is full of fascinating information on parts of the world little-known to most Westerners. For example, White's chapter on the Deccan war puts it in the context of regional religious conflict: &quot;When Guru Nanak Dev founded the Sikh religion in the 1500s, he had originally hoped to bring peace to India and reconcile Islam and Hinduism by reducing the rival faiths to their common moral elements and fusing them into a single pacifistic religion. Unfortunately this only created a ... third religion for everyone to fight over.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/bookreviews/s-1025798&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/bookreviews/s-1025798&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b4b954f28b67666dd7b67514521ce405b8208b8","amp;dn":"The+Great+Big+Book+of+Horrible+Things.Epub%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b4b954f28b67666dd7b67514521ce405b8208b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,75,149,79,40,182,118,102,221,123,103,81,69,33,206,64,91,130,8,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
