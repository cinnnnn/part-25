Hopefully this should be as complete as I can make it.\n\nFor those that just want Howl's Moving Castle with just the English language, use this torrent instead (Video quality is identical): &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7721220&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7721220&lt;/a&gt;\n\n1080p Video Ripped from Blu-ray:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Howls-Moving-Castle-Blu-ray-Mayazaki/dp/B007I77P0Q/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Howls-Moving-Castle-Blu-ray-Mayazaki/dp/B007I77P0Q/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish: AC3 5.1 Channels - Bitrate 448Kbps Audio ripped from DVD:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Howls-Moving-Castle-Jean-Simmons/dp/B000CDGVOE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Howls-Moving-Castle-Jean-Simmons/dp/B000CDGVOE&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJapanese: DTS 5.1 Channels - Bitrate: 1 561 Kbps / 1 510 Kpbs ripped from Blu-ray disc.\n\nCantonese: AC3 5.1 Channels - Bitrate 640Kbps ripped from Blu-ray disc.\n\nEnglish, Japanese, and Chinese Subtitles Ripped from Blu-ray Disc.\n\n\nVideo encoded using Ripbot264:\nCRF17, H.264 settings: --profile high --preset medium --level 4.0 --aud --nal-hrd vbr --bframes 5 --b-adapt 2 --vbv-bufsize 25000 --vbv-maxrate 25000 --slices 4 --b-pyramid strict --subme 10 --aq-mode 2 --me umh --trellis 2 --sar 1:1\n\nEnglish Audio was demuxed from DVD in it's native 448 kbs AC3 format.  Using Audacity, the beginning was trimmed the match the sync of the blu-ray audio and then the end was trimmed to exactly match the blu-ray audio length.  The result was then exported as AC3 448kbs.  Quality should be 100% identical to the DVD's AC3 448kbs stream.\n\nThis torrent are for those that must have the Japanese audio instead of just the English.  I included the Cantonese audio as well for good measure.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1a992a1aea62ce0044b963706586b9b6b1ff526","amp;dn":"Howl%27s+Moving+Castle+2004+1080p+English%2FJapanese%2FCantonese+-+Kit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1a992a1aea62ce0044b963706586b9b6b1ff526","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,169,146,161,174,166,44,224,4,75,150,55,6,88,107,155,107,31,245,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
