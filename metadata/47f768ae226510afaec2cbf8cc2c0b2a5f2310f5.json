Thankfully, Bridges, who played piano and sang with the Motley Crew from 1953 to 1966, was recently persuaded to reconsider. &quot;Keys to the Blues&quot; will make you glad that he did. From the moment the band comes crashing in on &quot;You Talk Too Much,&quot; right through to the closing bars of &quot;Three OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢clock Blues,&quot; this is an album that will keep you interested and entertained throughout.\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
