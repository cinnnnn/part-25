This book will be invaluable as it covers not only detailed and systematic presentations of the theory and applications of the various methods and techniques used in dealing with many different classes of series and integrals associated with the Zeta and related functions but stimulating historical accounts of a large number of problems and well-classified tables of series and integrals.\n\nDetailed and systematic presentations of the theory and applications of the various methods and techniques used in dealing with many different classes of series and integrals associated with the Zeta and related functions\n\n\n# Hardcover: 674 pages\n# Publisher: Elsevier; 1 edition (November 8, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0123852188\n# ISBN-13: 978-0123852182","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c2032a08ef1c55c95d1cfb131d636573ed1d289","amp;dn":"Zeta+and+q-Zeta+Functions+and+Associated+Series+and+Integrals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c2032a08ef1c55c95d1cfb131d636573ed1d289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,32,50,160,142,241,197,92,149,209,207,177,49,214,54,87,62,209,210,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
