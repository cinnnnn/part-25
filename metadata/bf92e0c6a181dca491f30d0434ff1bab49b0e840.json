So keep watch.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nI will be moving on to x265 for HQ Video encoding &amp; He-AACv2 for Superior Audio.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is x265?\n\nIt is something which gives you upto 50% better compression when compared to x264 at the same bitrates.\nBut, there is still a lot of optimizing left to do for x265 devs. Many features which are available in x264 are not yet available in x265 not to mention the ridiculous ETA for each encode.\n\nA while ago when I tried x265 it had so many glitches that encoding it became pointless.\nCBR was the only available option at that time. But since then, a lot of improvements started showing up. Now CQ &amp; CRF are available, and it won't be long before 2 pass and other features of x264 start showing up.\n\nCurrently the downside to encoders is that it takes up a lot more time than x264 since x265 is much more CPU intensive.\n\nThat said, I am still sold on x265; the detail it can retain at nominal bit rates is great. After doing a few high resolution tests, I was convinced about the capabilities of x265.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nI have improved on my Audio workflow too, and now it will be better than my usual encodes. Improvements in Bass &amp; Surround Sound are included with audio encode with very high transparency. Audio will now be encoded using HE-AACv2.\n\nWhat is HE-AACv2?\n\nIt has a high compressibility and retains much more detail than AAC. It is an upgrade over many popular formats like MP3, AAC, AC3, etc.\n\n-------------------------------------------\nPlayback notes:\n-------------------------------------------\n\nTested with MPC(HC &amp; BE) v1.7.1 [32 &amp; 64 bit] (K-lite &amp; CCCP) and VLC 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.\n\nConfigs tested:\n~i7 2600 + GTX 540\n~core 2 Quad + AMD Radeon 5850\n\nCpu usage for 1080p playback&gt;&gt; ~50-85% in Quad core, 20-50% in i7\nCpu usage for 720p playback&gt;&gt; ~25-65% in Quad core, 10-30% in i7\n\nI'm guessing that it will not playback fluently on anything lower than quadcore due to the CPU usage level in quad core itself.\nSo if you've got anything lower than a quad core, or an i5 system, then it would be wise to skip all x265-1080p rips for now.\n\n-CCCP flawless playback, no issues with the 27th Nov release.\n-K-lite codec pack seems to be dropping frames but it can be re-configured.\n-64 bit version of MPC-HC needs to be configured correctly for flawless playback.\n-VLC may have issues with seeking; other than that, playback itself is flawless.\n\nSo all things considered I would recommend CCCP's configuration atm.\n\nCombined Community Codec Pack + Media Player - Classic Home Cinema Link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cccp-project.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cccp-project.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVLC media player link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFile info:\n----------\nGeneral\nUnique ID : 177736459335945372611509590674403651933 (0x85B6CC033D9196778E86930865DA715D)\nComplete name : Opening 16 - Kota Shinzato - Hands Up!
