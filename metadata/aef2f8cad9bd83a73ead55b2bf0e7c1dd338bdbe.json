ConstantineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chance encounter with a new friend, Ollie, and their involvement with a beautiful young girl named Pamela, eventually lead the friends to an occult garden party that is somehow related to Morpheus, the Dream KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s imprisonment in the Waking World.\n\nNow as an adult, Ollie is haunted by dreams of terrible events from the past. PamelaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final fate in the present once again draws together the adult Ollie and Constantine, as they try to understand, and defeat, the demonic forces that possessed their friend in the 1960s.\n\nThis three-issue mini-series provides a fascinating glimpse of HellblazerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s John Constantine as a young boy, at a time when he was still just building his knowledge of the arcane.\n\nNOTE:  These are not my scans.  All praise and glory to the original scanners (and authors/artists/publishers,) please.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aef2f8cad9bd83a73ead55b2bf0e7c1dd338bdbe","amp;dn":"Love+Street+%28Complete%29+%28No+ads%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aef2f8cad9bd83a73ead55b2bf0e7c1dd338bdbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,242,248,202,217,189,131,167,62,173,85,178,191,14,124,29,211,56,189,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
