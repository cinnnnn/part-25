His political\nstance made him unpopular with the UK's intelligence\nservices, who seem to have blackmailed him into doing\nsome work for them. At the same time he was posting\narticles sympathetic to the Bolshevik's.\n\nThis is some of the story.\n\nCast\nArthur Ransome - Rory Kinnear\nLenin  -  Gordon Mounsey\nTrotsky - Mark Chatterton\nEvgenia Shelepina  - Michelle Dockery\nIvy  - Katie Collier\nForeign Office Minister  -  Gordon Mounsey\nLockhart - Mark Chatterton\nRussian Officer - Joe Hughes\nTabitha - Emily Herbert\nYoung Arthur - George Herbert\nSoldier - Christopher Anderton\nSoldier - Christopher Arley\nSoldier - Joe Hughes &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1922/nov/05.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1922/nov/05.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdb2c0246c3b9a8f36002a4913110af212fec076","amp;dn":"BBC+R3+-+Garry+Lyons%5C%27+%5C%27Amazonia%2C+A+Portrait+Of+Arthur+Rans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdb2c0246c3b9a8f36002a4913110af212fec076","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,178,192,36,108,59,154,143,54,0,42,73,19,17,10,242,18,254,192,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
