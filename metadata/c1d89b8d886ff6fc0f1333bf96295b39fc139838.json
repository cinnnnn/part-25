In this time of great economic, political, social and environmental upheaval, there has never been a greater need for the transforming power of the religion of the Kingdom of Heaven without all the convoluted and complicated doctrines which have been added to the simple truth that God is our Father and we are his Sons.\n\nJoshua ben Joseph\n\nJesusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ name in Hebrew is Yeshua. Due to the subtleties of translation, the name Yeshua became IÃ„â€œsoÃƒÂ»s in Greek Ã¢â‚¬â€œ pronounced YesuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢os. The 'us' was added on in keeping with the custom of the time: as in Marcus or Barnabus. This in turn became Jesus when transliterated into English which is how he is known in the Western world to this day. A much more accurate translation of his name is Joshua. His earthly father's name was Joseph - so he was Joshua ben Joseph - that is Joshua son of Joseph, or Yeshua ben Yesuf in his mother tongue.\n\n\nwww.joshuabook.org\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1d89b8d886ff6fc0f1333bf96295b39fc139838","amp;dn":"The+Joshua+Book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1d89b8d886ff6fc0f1333bf96295b39fc139838","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,216,155,141,136,111,246,252,15,19,51,191,150,41,91,57,252,19,152,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
