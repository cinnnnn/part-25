Over the\nyears the number of bandsmen gradually increased and quality was raised, partly\nby engaging former military bandsmen and, in more recent decades, musicians\nwith civilian college of music training. As long as the band belonged to the\ntramways it was stipulated that bandsmen served as tram drivers etc. during\npart of their working time.\nSince 1992 the orchestra has been organised as a foundation.\nGWO's home venue is Gothenburg's oldest secular building &quot;The Crown house&quot;\n(1654), where concerts are performed all year round. ln addition, the orchestra\ntours the Gothenburg region, occasionally also abroad.\n\nThe orchestra has performed under the following names:\n\nGÃƒÂ¶teborg Wind Orchestra (GWO) 2007-\n1997 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2008 they were commissioned to perform as The Swedish Air Force Band.\nGÃƒÂ¶teborgsMusiken 1992 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2007\n1905 - 1991 GÃƒÂ¶teborgs SpÃƒÂ¥rvÃƒÂ¤gars MusikkÃƒÂ¥r(Gothemburg TramwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Band)\n\nSwedish release 1997: GÃƒÂ¶teborgsMusiken - At Work\nConductor: Jerker Johansson\nRecorded at FiskebÃƒÂ¤ckskyrkan (FiskebÃƒÂ¤ck church) 23-25 October 1996\n\nWith art work.\n\n01  GWO - At Work - The Typewriter  \n                    Typewriter: Jerker Johansson\n02  GWO - At Work - Ankan och hackspeten (The Duck and the Woodpecker)\n                    Duckpipe and wood block: Jerker Johansson\n03  GWO - At Work - The Syncopated Clock  \n                    Wood block and alarm clock: Jerker Johansson\n04  GWO - At Work - The Fly  \n                    Flute: GÃƒÂ¶ran Marcusson, Piccolo: Tina Andersson\n05  GWO - At Work - Bugler's Holiday  \n                    Trumpet: David GlÃƒÂ¤nneskog, Peder Hansson, Robin Rydqvist\n06  GWO - At Work - Sandpaper Ballet  \n                    Sand paper: Lars Eliasson\n07  GWO - At Work - Till Minne av Cirkus Renz (In Memory of Cirkus Renz)  \n                    Xylophone: Jerker Johansson\n08  GWO - At Work - GotlÃƒÂ¤ndsk Sommarnatt (Gotland Summer Night)\n                    Trumpet: Peder Hansson\n09  GWO - At Work - Ol' Man River  \n                    Bass trombone: Anders Hellman\n10  GWO - At Work - Clarinet Candy  \n                    Clarinet: GÃƒÂ¶ran Carlsson, Ola Persson,\n                              Sven Pettersson, Kjell Gustafsson\n11  GWO - At Work - Portrait of a Trumpet  \n                    Trumpet: Robin Rydqvist\n12  GWO - At Work - Hagby's Trombone  \n                    Trombone: Robert Svensson, Lars-GÃƒÂ¶ran Lasses, Anders Hellman\n13  GWO - At Work - Interlude Romantique  \n                    Tenor saxophone: GÃƒÂ¶ran Selmerborn\n14  GWO - At Work - Festival-Polka  \n                    Xylophone and Kazoo: Jerker Johansson\n15  GWO - At Work - Hora Staccato  \n                    Trumpet: David GlÃƒÂ¤nneskog\n16  GWO - At Work - CsÃƒÂ¡rdÃƒÂ¡s  \n                    Euphonium: Anders Lundin\n17  GWO - At Work - Ko-Polka (Cow-Polka)  \n                    Cow bells: Jerker Johansson\n18  GWO - At Work - Der Alte BrummbÃƒÂ¤r (The Old Brown Bear)  \n                    Bassoon (Fagott): Howard Etherton\n19  GWO - At Work - Den Flygande Tomten (The Flying Santa)  \n                    Xylophone: Jerker Johansson\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.flc.se/goteborg.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.flc.se/goteborg.htm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec7528677525de563ae73fd651ffd35cbf9c6b2b","amp;dn":"G%26ouml%3Bteborg+Wind+Orchestra+%28GWO%29+-+At+Work+%5B1997%5D++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec7528677525de563ae73fd651ffd35cbf9c6b2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,117,40,103,117,37,222,86,58,231,63,214,81,255,211,92,191,156,107,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
