Robert Douglas, Earl of Dunlorn, returns to Lusara after three years only to find his country caught in the tyranny of the Guilde. And, even as the vanquished people cry out for a savior, other cataclysmic events unfold--events that will determine the fate not only of Lusara, but of the whole world. Robert, who possesses magical power greater than any before him, must now make a choice: to remain true to his vow never to oppose the usurper king or break his promise, assume responsibility, and save his beloved homeland. Then he and his brother rescue the orphan Jenn and discover in her a new kind of sorcerer--one whose talents may be as great as Robert's. And, with Jenn come new possibilities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6714b45556041f04c72627917595276767640ae","amp;dn":"Exile%27s+Return+%5BElita+Book+1%5D+-+Kate+Jacoby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6714b45556041f04c72627917595276767640ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,113,75,69,85,96,65,240,76,114,98,121,23,89,82,118,118,118,64,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
