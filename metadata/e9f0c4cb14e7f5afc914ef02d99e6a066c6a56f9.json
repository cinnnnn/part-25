By the time he was ten years old he knew he wanted to be an artist, and after leaving school he went on to study at Bradford Art College and later at the Royal College of Art in London. Bursting onto the scene at the Young Contemporaries exhibition, Hockney was quickly heralded as the golden boy of postwar British art and a leading proponent of pop art. It was during the swinging 60s in London that he befriended many of the seminal cultural figures of the generation and throughout these years Hockney's career grew.

Since then, the most prestigious galleries across the world have devoted countless shows to his extraordinary work.\nIn the seventies he expanded his range of projects, including set and costume design for operas and experiments with photography, lithography, and even photocopying.
