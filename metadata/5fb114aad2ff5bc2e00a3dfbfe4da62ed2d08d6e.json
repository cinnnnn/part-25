You really would need very expensive speakers to hear the difference from FLAC.  Fuck the MP3; it's outdated and should never be used again.\n\nAbout the artist:\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lumineers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lumineers&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Lumineers\n\nSource:  FLAC from TPB\nEncoding: MPEG-4 HE AAC v2 VBR\n\nEncoder Settings:  \nExtension: m4a\nQuality: Maximum\nBit rate: 48\nVBR:  On\nEncoder: Max 0.9.1\n\nAbout HE AAC v2:\n\nHigh Efficiency AAC v2 Profile defined in 2006, uses AAC-LC, SBR, PS\n\nAdvanced Audio Coding is designed to be the successor of the MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3, known as MP3 format.  \n\nHE-AAC v2, a.k.a. aacPlus v2 or eAAC+, the combination of Parametric Stereo (PS) and HE-AAC; used for even lower bitrates; defined in 2004 and 2006\n\nAAC and HE-AAC are better than MP3 at low bit rates (typically less than 128 kilobits per second). This is especially true at very low bit rates where the superior stereo coding, pure MDCT, and better transform window sizes leave MP3 unable to compete.\n\nWhile the MP3 format has near-universal hardware and software support, primarily due to MP3 being the format of choice during the crucial first few years of widespread music file-sharing/distribution over the internet, AAC is a strong contender due to some unwavering industry support\n\n[01:50] 01.
