Trouble ensues when it turns out the apartment belongs to someone else. The next day, Charlie's fence hires him to steal an ordinary-looking oil painting - from the same address. Mere coincidence? Charlie reckons there's no harm in finding out - until a dead body turns up in his living room. Hiding in a Montmartre hotel, Charlie tries to work out how to save his skin, while also placating his agent Victoria, who has arrived unannounced in the mistaken belief that Charlie actually looks like the author photo he provided. \n\nUnabridged (ca. 8 hours 15 minutes)\nRead by Simon Vance\nMP3/128 bit\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7156547b9e9b39d8406a1e559d37eb230bf30823","amp;dn":"Chris+Ewan+-+The+Good+Thief%27s+Guide+to+Paris+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7156547b9e9b39d8406a1e559d37eb230bf30823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,86,84,123,158,155,57,216,64,106,30,85,157,55,235,35,11,243,8,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
