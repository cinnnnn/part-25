Down the Up Escalator is an urgent dispatch from the front lines of our vast collective struggle to keep our heads above water and maybe evenÃ¢â‚¬â€somedayÃ¢â‚¬â€get ahead. Garson has interviewed an economically and geographically wide variety of Americans to show the painÃ‚Â­ful waste in all this loss and insecurity, and describe how individuals are coping. Her broader historical focus, though, is on the causes and consequences of the long stagÃ‚Â­nation of wages and how it has resulted in an increasingly desperate reliance on credit and a series of ever-larger bubblesÃ¢â‚¬â€stocks, technology, real estate. This is no way to run an economy, or a democracy.\n\n2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1ab03d1713afc914001366fb8547d257c127fce","amp;dn":"Down+the+Up+Escalator%3A+How+the+99+Percent+Live+%282013%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1ab03d1713afc914001366fb8547d257c127fce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,171,3,209,113,58,252,145,64,1,54,111,184,84,125,37,124,18,127,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
