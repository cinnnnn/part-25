The company was a pioneer in color printing technologies in children's books.[2] The company specialized in retellings or bowdlerizations of classic stories for children. The artistic and commercial roots of the McLoughlin firm were first developed by John McLoughlin, Jr. (1827Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1905) who made his younger brother Edmund McLoughlin (1833 or 4-1889) a partner in 1855. By 1886, the firm published a wide range of items, including cheap chapbooks, large folio picture books, linen books, puzzles, games and paper dolls. Many of the earliest and most valuable board games in America were produced by McLoughlin Brothers of New York. In 1920 the corporation was sold to Milton Bradley &amp; Company. McLoughlin ceased game production at this time, but continued publishing their picture books.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thefreedictionary.com/bowdlerization&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thefreedictionary.com/bowdlerization&lt;/a&gt;\n [After Thomas Bowdler (1754-1825), who published an expurgated edition of Shakespeare in 1818.]\n\n\nDescription:\n\nGoody Two-Shoes is the story of the little girl who overcomes many obstacles by always choosing what is right and fair.\n\n\n\nNote:  So that images would display on a new screen when reading this ebook, I used the html: Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpage-break-before: alwaysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. I tried this both internally and inline. This caused the epub not to display all the pages with the Application Aldiko for Android. Files both worked fine when using Moon+ Reader for Android and Calibre for PC for the epub, and Kindle for both PC and android for the mobi.\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e271cb32f84f3bacb08208e5a7907b87b4da239","amp;dn":"Goody+Two+Shoes+ebook+McLoughlin+Brothers+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e271cb32f84f3bacb08208e5a7907b87b4da239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,39,28,179,47,132,243,186,203,8,32,142,90,121,7,184,123,77,162,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
