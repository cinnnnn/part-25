It reappeared the following month, in toned-down form, and continued publication until November 1977, at which point it was merged with Battle Picture Weekly. Despite its short lifespan, Action was highly influential on the British comics scene, and was a direct forerunner of the long-running 2000 AD.\n\nIt should not be confused with Action Comics, the American comic book that introduced Superman.\n\nThis collection is the complete run of pre-ban issues that were published between 14th February 1976 and 16th October 1976, and the unpublished 23rd October Edition.\n\n\nF i L E i N F O\n\nTiTLE.....[ Action Summer Special\nYEAR......[ 1976\nGENRE.....[ Action | Horror | Sci-Fi | Thriller\nCBDB......[ http://www.comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=14294\n\nLANGUAGE..[ English\nCOLOUR....[ Black &amp; White, Colour\nFORMAT....[ Anthology\nFREQUENCY.[ Annual\n\nCOUNTRY...[ UK\nPUBLiSHER.[ IPC Magazines\niSSUE.....[ 1\n\nN O T E S\n\nExtra features in this special were cartoon page It&amp;#039;s A Laugh, a two page Knowall special, a Formula One colour centre spread entitled Speed!, A double page of Krazy Kaptions, a page of Canny Cricket tips and a full page Action Mouse strip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b1db6de94409eb34b8c7a92b58c7cc063832345","amp;dn":"Action+Pre-Ban+Collection+%281976%29+%28TFO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b1db6de94409eb34b8c7a92b58c7cc063832345","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,29,182,222,148,64,158,179,75,140,122,146,181,140,124,192,99,131,35,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
