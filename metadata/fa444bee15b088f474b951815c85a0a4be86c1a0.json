To avoid the department knowing he was moonlighting, however legally, Morisi began signing his work only with his initials Ã¢â‚¬â€ PAM, the &quot;M&quot; rendered without connectors, as &quot;|||&quot;. He retired from the force in 1976.\nMorisi's character Thunderbolt debuted in Peter Cannon ... Thunderbolt #1 (Jan. 1966), part of Charlton editor Dick Giordano's &quot;Action Heroes&quot; superhero line. The series then took over the numbering of the defunct title Son of Vulcan, and ran from issue #50-60 (MarchÃ¢â‚¬â€œApril 1966 - Nov. 1967), by which time Morisi, time-pressed with police work, had turned it over to other hands. When DC Comics bought the rights to Charlton's superhero properties in 1983, Thunderbolt was one of the characters originally planned for use in writer Alan Moore's miniseries Watchmen; when DC chose to save those characters for other uses, Moore adapted him into Ozymandias (Adrian Veidt)\n\n\n11 issues published by Charlton 1966-1967\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa444bee15b088f474b951815c85a0a4be86c1a0","amp;dn":"Peter+Cannon%2C+Thunderbolt+%23+51-60+%28Charlton%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa444bee15b088f474b951815c85a0a4be86c1a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,68,75,238,21,176,136,244,116,185,81,129,92,133,160,164,190,134,193,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
