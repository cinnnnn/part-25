I actually  would be happy to get 99 persons to pledge $1 so i can at least get the IOS developer license.\n\nThank you and share with a friend if you can.\n\n\nMain development Site:http://www.indiedb.com/games/flickit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fd85b868c3e58fc2d97cf38554b640faf739a4a","amp;dn":"Flickit+Mac+Os+Physics+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fd85b868c3e58fc2d97cf38554b640faf739a4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,216,91,134,140,62,88,252,45,151,207,56,85,75,100,15,175,115,154,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
