Set hundreds of years after Minecraftian, this series tells the story of a 'new' Steve and his adventures in Minecraftia. The story has lots of twists and turns, it ties in a lot with Minecraftian and could be considered a sequel. This episode is shorter than future episodes will be since I want to hear feedback before continuing. Also, this episode was just to introduce the legend of the Minecraftian which will be my next upload enjoy all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21f6406fd2cade495b75c869fc5b75efaf3d7cd7","amp;dn":"Steve+of+Minecraftia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21f6406fd2cade495b75c869fc5b75efaf3d7cd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,246,64,111,210,202,222,73,91,117,200,105,252,91,117,239,175,61,124,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
