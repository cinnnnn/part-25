The goal is to achieve high efficiency, which is essential to meet consumersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ growing need for longer battery lives. The focus is to study topologies amiable for full on-chip implementation (few external components) in the mainstream CMOS technology, which will reduce the physical size and the manufacturing cost of the devices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c67f3a0a6d9c449ebed24a9d4248a170ed2e926f","amp;dn":"CMOS+High+Efficiency+On-chip+Power+Management+%28Analog+Circuits+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c67f3a0a6d9c449ebed24a9d4248a170ed2e926f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,127,58,10,109,156,68,158,190,210,74,157,66,72,161,112,237,46,146,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
