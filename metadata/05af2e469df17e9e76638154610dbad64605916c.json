From pop star to reggae radical, musical entrepreneur to the inventor of ringbang, the artist has cut a swath through the world of music and made it his own.\n\nBorn in Plaisance, Guyana, on March 5, 1948, the young Edmond Grant grew up on the sound of his homeland, tan singing, an Indo-Caribbean vocal style whose roots lay in South Asia and are the backbone of modern chutney. Then in 1960, the Grant family emigrated to England, taking up residence in the working-class Stoke Newington area of London. The young teen's musical horizons swiftly expanded, embracing the R&amp;B, blues, and rock that percolated across his new island home. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tReggae\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Gimme Hope Jo'anna\n02.I Don't Wanna Dance\n03.Electric Avenue\n04.Walking On Sunshine\n05.Living On The Frontline\n06.Do You Feel My Love\n07.War Party\n08.Till I Can't Take Love No More\n09.Boys In The Street\n10.Baby Come Back\n11.Romancing The Stone\n12.Hello Africa\n13.Neighbour Neighbour\n14.Say I Love You\n15.California Style\n16.Dance Party\n17.East Dry River (Ska Version)\n18.Gotta Be Positive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n               ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05af2e469df17e9e76638154610dbad64605916c","amp;dn":"Eddy+Grant+-+Very+Best+Of+Road+To+Reparation+%282008%29+MP3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05af2e469df17e9e76638154610dbad64605916c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,175,46,70,157,241,126,158,118,99,129,84,97,13,186,214,70,5,145,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
