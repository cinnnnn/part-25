One Miracle. Oh Glorious, Glorious Day!\n\n&quot;May it haunt [my readers&amp;#039;] houses pleasantly,&quot; Charles Dickens wrote in the preface to his A Christmas Carol. This 1938 version offers one of that timeless work&amp;#039;s most pleasant screen hauntings, bustling with a lavish backlot re-creation of Victorian London. Reginald Owen portrays holiday humbug Ebenezer Scrooge, the miser&amp;#039;s miser who has a huge change of heart after spirits whisk him into the past, present and future.\n\nGene Lockhart, who like Owen would appear in well over 100 films, plays dutiful Bob Cratchit. There&amp;#039;s a genuine air of family in the Cratchit household scenes, in part because Lockhart&amp;#039;s real-life wife Kathleen plays Mrs. Cratchit. From sets to stars to story, this triumphant adaptation adds a glow to the season. Like Tiny Tim&amp;#039;s benediction, it blesses us - every one.\n\nCast &amp; Crew\nActors:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Lynne Carver\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Terry Kilburn\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Kathleen Lockhart\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Reginald Owen\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Gene Lockhart\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Barry Mackay\nWriters:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Hugo Butler\n\nProducers:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Joseph L.
