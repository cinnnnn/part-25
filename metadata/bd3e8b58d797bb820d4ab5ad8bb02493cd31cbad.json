Well,  thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what  famous mountaineer \nGeorge Mallory once said when a cheeky journalist asked him \nthe same question.  But there are lots of  great reasons to \nwrite about the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highest mountain. Did you know that \nMount Everest  is so close to  space, the sky is  black? Or \nthat  at Base  Camp, you  sleep on  a river  of ice  (which \ncreaks and moans  beneath you)? Or that  mountains can make \nyou crazy enough to walk off a cliff, see people who arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t \nthere or strip naked in sub-zero temperatures? ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true!   \n\n     ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s awesome  facts, spooky  mysteries and  best of \nall, death-  defying stories  of brave adventurers.  My own \nmountain experience  is rather  less inspiring:  on finally \nstumbling up  a snowy 6000-metre  pass in Nepal,  I groaned \nand  threw up  green bile  in front  of a  friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s camera! \nApart from a sore  stomach and a less-than-glamorous photo, \nit  gave me  a  deep admiration  for  mountaineers -  their \nbravery, their determination,  and their cast-iron stomachs \n. . .  And not just the record-holders  like Edmund Hillary \nand Tenzing Norgay, but the  many people who find their own \nchallenges to  face, their own  mountains to climb.  I hope \nyou find yours.                                             \n\n     Take care, and happy adventuring! \n\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd3e8b58d797bb820d4ab5ad8bb02493cd31cbad","amp;dn":"Its+True%21+Everest+Kills%2C+Kim+Wilson.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd3e8b58d797bb820d4ab5ad8bb02493cd31cbad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,62,139,88,215,151,187,130,13,74,181,173,139,176,36,147,205,49,203,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
