The love of his life thinks he's a geek ... that is if she notices him at all. Pretty normal, and pretty boring, really. But this normal life is about to change forever. On a school science trip to watch the test firing of a new particle accelerator, Arn is caught up in an accident that propels him into an extraordinary new world. In this new land, Arn is the last human alive. It is populated with mysterious and bloodthirsty creatures, some of whom want him dead, while others see him as their only hope for survival. Can Arn survive in a hostile world and save his new friends? Or has he arrived in time to witness the fall of a mighty empire? An epic tale of love, betrayal and war in a world both familiar and terrifying.\n\nEPUB,MOBI AND TXT.
