You Keep Me Hanging On\n12. Cry Like A Baby (orig. single A-side)\n13. The Door You Closed To Me (orig. single B-side)\n\n\nI'm afraid this isn't FLAC but 320 mp3. I haven't ripped this but downloaded it years ago and it seems no seeds are available anymore.\n\nIt's a great album, indeed I bought it in 1968 (good old vinyl of course).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60eb0654912873870d1e6533d24dbe1732d8fb78","amp;dn":"Box+Tops+-+Cry+Like+A+Baby+%281968+album%29%2B+Bonus+%28320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60eb0654912873870d1e6533d24dbe1732d8fb78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,235,6,84,145,40,115,135,13,30,101,51,210,77,190,23,50,216,251,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
