Fragile # # # \n12. 8, 9, 10\n\nThe second album from The Burns Unit member Kim Edgar raises the bar from where her acclaimed debut album left off, mixing delicate folk rock melodies with KimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uniquely Scottish and poignant lyrics. EdgarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s harmonious piano playing and a voice full of emotion help bring to life heavy issues ranging from child neglect to mortality. Intense and thought provoking whilst being an enjoyable listen, The Ornate Lie is another success in the career of Edgar, surely public acclaim must follow soon. Tracks Ã¢â‚¬ËœNot for SharingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœFragileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the powerfully emotional yet warm Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Steamy NoteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cannot be ignored.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a42a12efcd5d992dd7fb3079b812eef057184b8","amp;dn":"Kim+Edgar+-+The+Ornate+Lie+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a42a12efcd5d992dd7fb3079b812eef057184b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,66,161,46,252,213,217,146,221,127,179,7,155,129,46,239,5,113,132,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
