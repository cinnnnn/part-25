Sherman, Ph.D., Past-President International Dyslexia Association.\nDid you know that many successful architects, lawyers, engineersÃ¢â‚¬â€even bestselling novelistsÃ¢â‚¬â€had difficulties learning to read and write as children? In this groundbreaking book, Brock and Fernette Eide explain how 20% of peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€individuals with dyslexiaÃ¢â‚¬â€share a unique learning style that can create advantages in a classroom, at a job, or at home. Using their combined expertise in neurology and education, the authors show how these individuals not only perceive the written word differently but may also excel at spatial reasoning, see insightful connections that others simply miss, understand the world in stories, and display amazing creativity. Blending personal stories with hard science, The Dyslexic Advantage provides invaluable advice on how parents, educators, and individuals with dyslexia can recognize and use the strengths of the dyslexic learning style in: material reasoning (used by architects and engineers); interconnected reasoning (scientists and designers), narrative reasoning (novelists and lawyers); and dynamic reasoning (economists and entrepreneurs.)\nWith prescriptive advice and inspiring testimonials, this paradigm-shifting book proves that dyslexia doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to be a detriment, but can often become an asset for success.\nGenre: Non-Fiction&gt; Psychology &amp; Counseling&gt; Neuropsychology\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2ca54be10b5eeeb6dba343fdbd7a09e7cc79f15","amp;dn":"Dyslexic+Advantage_+Unlocking+the+Hidden+Potentia%2C+The+-+Eide+M.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2ca54be10b5eeeb6dba343fdbd7a09e7cc79f15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,202,84,190,16,181,238,235,109,186,52,63,219,215,160,158,124,199,159,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
