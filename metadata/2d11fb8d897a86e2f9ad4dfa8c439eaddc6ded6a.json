Fox, the comic's artist and creator, used the strip to comment on barbarian fashion-sense in fantasy games, and later expanded his heroine's story into a three-issue Redfox fanzine.\n\nThe fanzine stories were revised and redrawn to form the early issues of a bimonthly US-format black &amp; white comic. \n\nHarrier Comics published the first ten issues in the UK. Valkyrie Press was then established solely to publish Redfox.\n\nPlease SEED and enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d11fb8d897a86e2f9ad4dfa8c439eaddc6ded6a","amp;dn":"Redfox+%281986%29+The+Complete+Series+Harrier%2FValkyrie+Press+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d11fb8d897a86e2f9ad4dfa8c439eaddc6ded6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,17,251,141,137,122,134,226,249,173,77,250,140,67,158,173,220,109,237,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
