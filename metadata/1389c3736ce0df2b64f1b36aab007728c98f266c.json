And although the Victor artist contract sheets do list a Boogie Woogie Jump (with matrix 063862-1) to have been issued on RCA Victor LEJ-1 (10&quot; LP) and RCA Camden CAL-328 (12&quot; LP), no metal part or test with that matrix number exists in the vaults and both these RCA re-issues use the common 78 take (-2) of Boogie Woogie Man. Not included in this set is an alternate take (-1) which is almost identical to the issued take, and a -3 which is the same as the issued take. Some discographies cite -1 for the 78 release, yet the Victor file card states &quot;#1 unsightly light grooves&quot; and the only take marked for release was -2.\n________________________________________________________________________\n(I) PETE JOHNSON AND ALBERT AMMONS: Pete Johnson, Albert Ammons (p), Jimmy Hoskins (d).\nNYC, June 17, 1941\n066116-1 Foot Pedal Boogie Vic 27507\n066117-1 Walkin' The Boogie Vic 27505\n066118-1 Sixth Avenue Express Vic 27506\n066119-1 Pine Creek -\n066120-1 Movin' The Boogie Vic 27507\n________________________________________________________________________\n(J) PETE JOHNSON AND HIS BOOGIE WOOGIE BOYS: Hot Lips Page (tp), Buster Smith (as), Pete Johnson (p), Lawrence Lucie (g), Abe Bolar (b), Eddie Dougherty (d), Joe Turner (vcl).\nNYC, June 30, 1939\n25023-1 Cherry Red Voc 4997\n25024-1 Baby Look At You -\n-0- Jump For Joy Col CK 65631 (CD)\n25025-1 Lovin' Mama Blues Voc 5186\n\n(K) ALBERT, MEADE, PETE AND THEIR 3 PIANOS: Albert Ammons, Meade Lux Lewis, Pete Johnson (p), Abe Bolar (b), Eddie Dougherty (d), Joe Turner (vcl).\nsame session\n25026-1 CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Society Rag Voc 5186\n\nNote: Jump For Joy, which is on the same side of the lacquer disc as Lovin' Mama Blues, was not assigned any matrix or take number.
