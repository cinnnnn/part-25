Here they meet with members of the public who arrive, one by one, with an item they think might have value or be of special interest to the Dealers. With a huge breadth of knowledge and global connections, however rare, bizarre or expensive the items, the Dealers will offer top prices if they think they can find a way of turning it into profit. They may have different backgrounds in the world of high-stakes buying and selling but the Dealers all have deep pockets and are ready to bid against each other to get their hands on the collectibles.\n\n    * Antiques show CEO and pawn business owner, Scott Diament has been in the business for 18 years. There is no limit to what he can spend.\n    * Antiques and vintage collectibles boutique owner and dealer, Gillian Anderson Price has a client base including Kate Moss, Jude Law and the Gallagher brothers. She is particularly interested in fashion, jewellery and movie posters. \n    * Richard Gauntlett is a 20th century collectibles and antique car dealer who is a smooth operator, but despite his impeccable manners, he has an acid wit that will cut down unrealistic sellers.\n    * Jenny Patt is a high-end Chinese art and antiquities dealer and consultant who spent just under five years as the Chinese Painting Specialist at ChristieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in Hong Kong.\n    * Pawnbroker, Nikolas Robinson, deals with diamonds, jewels, art and antiques. He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t suffer fools gladly and can spot a fake from a mile off.\n\nChannel: Discovery Channel UK\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b29f7b4393132531849d6effb6ab80ba0085273","amp;dn":"Dealers.S01E02.hdtv.xvid-%5D%5B+Russian+helmet%2C+Rare+pieces+of+a+Met","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b29f7b4393132531849d6effb6ab80ba0085273","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,41,247,180,57,49,50,83,24,73,214,239,251,106,184,11,160,8,82,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
