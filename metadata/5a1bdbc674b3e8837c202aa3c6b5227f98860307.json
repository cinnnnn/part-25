Hadley (AgentParsec). It shares the same gameplay elements as the original - you must collect 8 pages while avoiding the enemy. This is not intended to be a copy - simply a way for people who loved Slender to be able to face their fear on a different map with the same awesome gameplay. There are some differences which will make playing a somewhat unique experience - different AI, new sounds, and a different environment.\n\nVersion 1.0 of Prison has been released.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a1bdbc674b3e8837c202aa3c6b5227f98860307","amp;dn":"Slender+-+Prison+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a1bdbc674b3e8837c202aa3c6b5227f98860307","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,27,219,198,116,179,232,131,124,32,42,163,198,181,34,127,152,134,3,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
