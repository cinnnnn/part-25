She then goes to class to find thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a new transfer student, Oogami Rei, who looks exactly like the boy she saw before and wears a black glove only on his left hand.\n\nOogami is a Code Breaker, one who Ã¢â‚¬Å“does not existÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. He is a seemingly cold-blooded killer who follows the principle of Ã¢â‚¬Å“an eye for an eyeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, to Ã¢â‚¬Å“use evil against evilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Convinced that killing is not right, Sakurakouji sets out to stop him and penetrate his icy heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfab1b29474cb28e1e1299b1430cf15b4b9a9b63","amp;dn":"CODE%3ABREAKER++Episode+1-13+%2B+uva","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfab1b29474cb28e1e1299b1430cf15b4b9a9b63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,171,27,41,71,76,178,142,30,18,153,177,67,12,241,91,75,154,155,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
