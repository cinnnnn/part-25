(released in the US as Tight Little Island) was a 1949 Ealing comedy film based on the novel of the same name by Compton MacKenzie. Both the movie and the novel are based on the real-life 1941 shipwreck of the S.S. Politician and the unauthorized taking of its cargo of whisky. The plot deals with the attempts of Scottish islanders to take advantage of an unexpected windfall, despite opposition from British authorities. It starred Basil Radford, Bruce Seton, Joan Greenwood and Gordon Jackson. This was Alexander Mackendrick's directorial debut.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8761df5be3b2aa32f37cce7598f86970e0c3250a","amp;dn":"Whisky+Galore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8761df5be3b2aa32f37cce7598f86970e0c3250a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,97,223,91,227,178,170,50,243,124,206,117,152,248,105,112,224,195,37,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
