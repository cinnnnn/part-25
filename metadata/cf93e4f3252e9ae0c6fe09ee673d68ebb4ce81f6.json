It tells the story of a peaceful wanderer named Himura Kenshin, formerly known as the assassin \\&quot;Hitokiri BattÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½sai\\&quot;. After participating during the Bakumatsu war, Kenshin wanders the countryside of Japan offering protection and aid to those in need as atonement for the murders he once committed as an assassin. When arriving in Tokyo in the 11th year of Meiji (1878), he meets a young woman named Kamiya Kaoru, who was in the middle of a fight with a murderer who claims to be the Hitokiri BattÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½sai from her swordmanship school. Kenshin decides to help her and defeats the fake BattÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½sai. After discovering that Kenshin is the real BattÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½sai, she offers him a place to stay at her dojo as she notes Kenshin is a gentle person instead. Kenshin accepts and begins to establish lifelong relationships with many people such as Sagara Sanosuke, a former SekihÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ Army member; MyÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½jin Yahiko, an orphan from a samurai family; and a doctor named Takani Megumi. However, he also deals with his fair share of enemies, new and old, including the former leader from the OniwabanshÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«, Shinomori Aoshi and his rival from the Bakumatsu SaitÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ Hajime.\n\nPLEASE SEED and COMMENT\n\n\n----------Puff...
