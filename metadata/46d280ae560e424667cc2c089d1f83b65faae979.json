Many of the tunes have an appealing &quot;island vacation&quot; feel to them--note the warm, bouncy calypso feel of &quot;Coconut Bread&quot; and the strutting light funk of &quot;Joyous Lake.&quot; &quot;Jo Jo&quot; reflects Rollins' 1960s freewheeling hard-bop jazz sound, and Dolly Parton's &quot;Here You Come Again&quot; gets a playful workout. &quot;Illusions&quot; features some steely yet soulful ballad playing.\n\nRollins' playing is melodically direct, full-bodied and gently rollicking, and guitarist Bobby Broom and vibist Bobby Hutcherson provide a shimmering, dancing backdrop. Drummer Tony Williams (who played in the superb Miles Davis Quintet in the 1960s) provides what can be best described as a rocking swing beat. No Problem is not for the fans of the Rollins classics , but smooth jazz-fans who are hungry for a bit of grit would do well to check this out.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. No Problem (7:43)\n2.
