The kidnappers get to their \nvictims by impersonating police officers. While investigating one of the \ndisappearances, one of the seven-ups gets spotted and is killed. The situation \nputs the seven-ups in a precarious position because it looks like they are tied \nto the kidnappings. So now one detective has to find the murderers and clear the \nseven-ups&amp;#039; soiled reputation.

It is the latest success of The Seven-Ups, a squad of \nundercover NY policemen whose collars regularly get sentences of seven years or \nup. Two mobsters are presently in the squad&amp;#039;s sights - Max Kalish, a \nbusinessman, and Festa, a bail bondsman. However, Buddy Manuchi, the Seven-Ups&amp;#039; \nleader, gets wind of strange and violent happenings within the mob, unaware that \nMax Kalish was kidnapped and held until payment of a huge ransom, and now he and \nother mobsters are in panic mode. Things then go from bad to worse for both The \nSeven-Ups and Kalish&amp;#039;s mob when one the the squad&amp;#039;s members is found out and \ntied up in a car trunk, only to see the real kidnappers grab Cotello, one of \nKalish&amp;#039;s partners, and blast him and the helpless undercover cop. When Buddy \narrives on the scene, the real killers flee, and a mad car chase through the \nstreets of New York blasts onto the country freeway and ends in a savage crash \ninto the underside of a crippled 18-wheeler. The Seven-Ups now probe to find out \nwho is kidnapping mobsters to find the killers of their partner, and Buddy \nsuddenly realizes they have a police mole working for them.
