A young boy runs in, deathly afraid. The men recognize him as the son of Richie Grenadine, a local man who was injured some time ago in a work accident, and was given lifetime worker's compensation. With no need to support himself, Richie became a recluse, rarely seen outside the confines of his apartment except to purchase the cheapest of beer, although lately, he had been sending his son out to purchase his beer for him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:504d9d34aad23c78ce9661805b884367338d54d6","amp;dn":"Stephen+King-Grey+Matter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"504d9d34aad23c78ce9661805b884367338d54d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,77,157,52,170,210,60,120,206,150,97,128,91,136,67,103,51,141,84,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
