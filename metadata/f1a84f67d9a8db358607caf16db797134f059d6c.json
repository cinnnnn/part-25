It's a bit much, even for the diehards, even if moments work pretty well. Nevertheless, those moments work because of pizzazz, although those are the very moments that will make most long-term Dylan fans bristle. Which, of course, raises the question -- who is this for? The dedicated aren't going to be dazzled by the slickness and the casual fans certainly aren't going to pay much attention to a live album from 1978. Interesting historically, perhaps, but only marginally. \n\n\n\nRelease Date\n 1979 \n\nDuration\n01:39:41 \n\nGenre:\nPop/Rock\n\nStyles:\n\nRock &amp; Roll\nSinger/Songwriter\nAlbum Rock\nContemporary Pop/Rock\n \n\nAlbum Moods:\n\nAutumnal  \nBitter  \nBittersweet  \nCynical/Sarcastic  \nEnigmatic  \nIntense  \nIntimate  \nLively  \nPoignant  \nSardonic  \nSearching  \nSnide  \nSwaggering  \nUrgent  \nWarm  \nWistful  \nYearning  \nAcerbic  \nEnergetic  \nFreewheeling  \nLiterate  \nReflective  \nRousing  \nWry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1a84f67d9a8db358607caf16db797134f059d6c","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+At+Budokan+%281978%29+2LP%27s+24bit%2F192khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1a84f67d9a8db358607caf16db797134f059d6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,168,79,103,217,168,219,53,134,7,202,241,109,183,151,19,79,5,157,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
