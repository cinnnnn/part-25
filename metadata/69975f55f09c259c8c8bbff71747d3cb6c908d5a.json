I used AVS Audio Converter 7. I got this audio book from the library.  Their are a lot of audio books at the library,that are not on the torrent sites. Another option is a audio book rental site like Their plans are,1 at a time $23.49,2 at a time $28.49,3 at a time $39.49, 4 at a time $50.49, 5 at a time $63.49, 6 at a time $75.49. They have 40,000 audiobook titles. If, more people uploaded audio books from the library orwould be a lot more audio books on the torrent sites. I,also, wish people would stop over compressing there audio books. I would rather listen to a larger audio book,that sounds great,than tiny that sounds like crap.
