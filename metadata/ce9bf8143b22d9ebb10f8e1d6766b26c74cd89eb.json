Written by A.G. Macdonnell; Full-cast dramatisation; Dramatised by Archie Scottney.\n\nA young Scot, Donald Cameron, invalided from the Western Front in 1918, finds himself commissioned to write a book about the eccentricities of the English - through a foreigner's eyes. An enthusiastic innocent abroad, Donald encounters an array of richly comic characters. He attends an absurd country house weekend, enjoys drinks with Fleet Street hacks, attempts some book-reviewing, visits The League of Nations as an MP's private secretary and, memorably, plays village cricket - the most famous fictional cricket match in literature.\n\nCast:\nDonald Cameron .....Tony Curran\nEvan Davies .....
