Caetano Veloso went to exile in the 70's under the order of the dictatorial governement, he lived in London UK and made this record in english. The music is a nice and light MPB. Here we can hear some mix about the traditional brazilian music and a little of the hippie sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75557a2ace51834578bf7d88e874ba6bf95b3984","amp;dn":"Caetano+-+London%2C+London+%281971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75557a2ace51834578bf7d88e874ba6bf95b3984","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,85,122,42,206,81,131,69,120,191,125,136,232,116,186,107,249,91,57,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
