The work revolves around four central characters: Othello, his wife Desdemona, his lieutenant Cassio, and his trusted advisor Iago. Attesting to its enduring popularity, the play appeared in 7 editions between 1622 and 1705. Because of its varied themes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ racism, love, jealousy and betrayal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it remains relevant to the present day and is often performed in professional and community theatres alike. The play has also been the basis for numerous operatic, film and literary adaptations.\n\nThis Audiobook is in the Public Domain:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://opencast.de/?p=166&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://opencast.de/?p=166&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fc4706e5908373bbf72fe6fce79bbb756fc50ef","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+Othello+-+By+William+Shakespeare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fc4706e5908373bbf72fe6fce79bbb756fc50ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,196,112,110,89,8,55,59,191,114,254,111,206,121,187,183,86,252,80,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
