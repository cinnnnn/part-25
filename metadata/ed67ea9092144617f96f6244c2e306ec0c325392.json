Ant updates us on a Gavin McInnes article and the repercussions he caught from it, he take a few agreeing and opposing calls on the topic, plays some viral &quot;ice bucket&quot; challenge videos and then, ogles a new Jess Greenberg song. He wraps up the show talking about Belle Knox, a new video game you'll want to get in on, and takes a few more listener calls.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed67ea9092144617f96f6244c2e306ec0c325392","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-08-21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed67ea9092144617f96f6244c2e306ec0c325392","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,103,234,144,146,20,70,23,249,111,98,68,194,227,6,236,12,50,83,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
