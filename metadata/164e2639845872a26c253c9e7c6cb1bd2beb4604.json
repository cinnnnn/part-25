We are living in the era of sound explosion. All the sound that we create is going to be in the atmosphere forever. We need peace in its literal sense. The peace in which the body can survive and the mind can create an imagination.\n\nSamir, a 10-year-old, is living in a chawl in a metropolis in India. Samir lives with his widowed mother and his grandfather. An only easy alternative to earn money arises with a grinding machine. The machine brings with it its horrible incessant and oppressive sound that not only takes away the physical space but the mental space as well of the whole family. Samir's innocent mind is alert to this oppression, and rebels against it.\n\n\n*Won National Award for best short film and best direction in 2005.\n\nSpecs:\nRuntime : 22:27\nFrame Width: 720\nFrame Height: 540\nFrame rate: 25 fps\nData rate: 1784 kbps\nTotal bitrate: 2104 kbps\nLanguage: Marathi\nSubtitles: English hardencoded\n\n\n*Not my rip*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:164e2639845872a26c253c9e7c6cb1bd2beb4604","amp;dn":"Girni+aka+Grinding+Machine+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"164e2639845872a26c253c9e7c6cb1bd2beb4604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,78,38,57,132,88,114,162,108,37,60,158,124,108,177,189,43,235,70,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
