They found mainly cult level success and recognition. Later they became cited as a pivotal influence on the early British punk rock movement.\n\nDoctors of Madness formed in 1974 in a cellar in Brixton, south London by the composer and lead singer/guitarist Richard Strange, known as Ã¢â‚¬ËœKidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Strange.\n\nTo provide a platform for his musical ideas and compositions analysing urban culture neurosis and systems of control, Strange joined forces with Urban Blitz (electric violin, baritone violectra and lead guitar) Stoner (vocals, bass guitar) and Peter DiLemma (vocals, drums) to provide the link between the early 70s progressive rock and glam rock of David Bowie and Roxy Music, and the later 70s punk rock of the Sex Pistols and The Clash. Doctors of Madness cited The Velvet Underground and writer William S. Burroughs as major influences on their music which fused avant-garde hard rock with warped quasi-classical tones.\n\n 01 50's Kids 3:04 \n 02 Into The Strange 2:58 \n 03 No Limits 4:41 \n 04 Bulletin 2:43 \n 05 Network 6:04 \n 06 Sons Of Survival 4:21 \n 07 Back From The Dead 1:46 \n 08 Triple Version 3:25 \n 09 Kiss Goodbye Tomorrow 2:18 \n 10 Cool 7:56 \n\n If you like the music, buy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1d491d3e61eca4d4ed64b9da1879387ae8879e4","amp;dn":"Doctors+of+Madness+-+Sons+of+Survival+%281978%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1d491d3e61eca4d4ed64b9da1879387ae8879e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,212,145,211,230,30,202,77,78,214,75,157,161,135,147,135,174,136,121,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
