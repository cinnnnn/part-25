As such, this monograph contains a diversity of research results that highlight the current understanding of how Hawaiian volcanoes work and point out fundamental questions requiring additional exploration. \n\nVolume highlights include: \n\nStudies that span a range of depths within Earth, from the deep mantle to the atmosphere\nMethods that cross the disciplines of geochemistry, geology, and geophysics to address issues of fundamental importance to HawaiÃ¢â‚¬ËœiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s volcanoes\nData for use in comparisons with other volcanoes, which can benefit from, and contribute to, a better understanding of HawaiÃ¢â‚¬Ëœi\nDiscussions of the current issues that need to be addressed for a better understanding of Hawaiian volcanism\nHawaiian Volcanoes, From Source to Surface will be a valuable resource not only for researchers studying basaltic volcanism and scientists generally interested in volcanoes, but also students beginning their careers in geosciences. This volume will also be of great interest to igneous petrologists, geochemists, and geophysicists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbd33f6bfbd77c2da9685252513292bef5cf7d5a","amp;dn":"Hawaiian+Volcanoes+From+Source+to+Surface+-+1st+Ed+%282015%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbd33f6bfbd77c2da9685252513292bef5cf7d5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,211,63,107,251,215,124,45,169,104,82,82,81,50,146,190,245,207,125,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
