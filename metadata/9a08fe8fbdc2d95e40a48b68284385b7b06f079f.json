And could it be that this master of mischief \nisnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really the villain heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been branded? Loki's insatiable lust for power and his feud \nwith Thor take on new meaning in this resonant epic\n\n\nRelease Description\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nBlood Brothers Pt.4\n\nPart four introduces us to Loki's biological mother, which felt a bit unexplored but the interest of the \nepisode is whether or not Thor will meet his end by way of execution. Once again Hela makes an appearance; and \nthe scene is amazing in both animation and dialogue. The episode overall is, once again, a fantastic piece of \nstorytelling with amazing artwork, but the ending was weak. Mostly it's because I felt for Loki as a character \nand he seemed cheated in the end, but it also could have been due to the whole anticlimactic way it was \napproached; they built up the episode only to have it just end so suddenly.\n\nThe series is phenomenal, period. From start to finish the series delivers beautiful artwork -- that blends \nelements of a motion comic with CG animation, great character development of Loki, and an awesome voice cast. \nThis has become a definite new favorite of mine, and not only has this series brought me tremendous \nanticipation for future projects by Marvel Knights but also has given me a new love for the Thor villain and \npiqued enough fascination for me to begin indulging in the Thor comic series.\n[i](from h**p://www.dailyblam.com/)[/i]\n\n\nSpoken Language, English\n\nh**p://www.imdb.com/news/ni9036116/\n\n======================================================\n\nScreens:\n-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n[URL=http://img64.imageshack.us/i/thorlokibloodbrotherss0.jpg/][IMG]http://img64.imageshack.us/img64/4919/thorlokibloodbrotherss0.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://img232.imageshack.us/i/thorlokibloodbrotherss0.jpg/][IMG]http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/4919/thorlokibloodbrotherss0.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://img220.imageshack.us/i/thorlokibloodbrotherss0n.jpg/][IMG]http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/3155/thorlokibloodbrotherss0n.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://img864.imageshack.us/i/thorlokibloodbrotherss0l.jpg/][IMG]http://img864.imageshack.us/img864/1551/thorlokibloodbrotherss0l.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://img847.imageshack.us/i/thorlokibloodbrotherss0c.jpg/][IMG]http://img847.imageshack.us/img847/6453/thorlokibloodbrotherss0c.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n[URL=http://img852.imageshack.us/i/thorlokibloodbrotherss0.jpg/][IMG]http://img852.imageshack.us/img852/4919/thorlokibloodbrotherss0.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n======================================================\n\nFile Info\n-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFormAT:- mkv\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 554M\nPlayTime           : 00:16:23.840\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 2\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nVideoWidth         : 1280 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 718 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 23.976fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 23588547\nVideoBitRate       : 0\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : A_AAC\nAudioBitRate       : 0\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 48000\nAudio 1# Stream\nAudioCodec         : A_AC3\nAudioBitRate       : 0\nAudioChannels      : 6\nAudioSampleRate    : 48000\n\n\n=================================================\n\nHash:\n------\n9A08FE8FBDC2D95E40A48B68284385B7B06F079F\n==================================================\n[/center]\n\n[url]http://www.cartoonpalace.info/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a08fe8fbdc2d95e40a48b68284385b7b06f079f","amp;dn":"Thor.Loki.Blood.Brothers.S01E04.Blood.Brothers.Pt.4.720p.WEB.DL.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a08fe8fbdc2d95e40a48b68284385b7b06f079f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,8,254,143,189,194,217,94,64,164,139,104,40,67,133,183,176,111,7,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
