Maybe you deleted a file you need back, or you clicked Yes when you should've clicked No. Or maybe you had a glitch on a memory card from your digital camera or the USB drive you use with your laptop.\n\nIf you catch it right away, you can often undo the deletion in Windows or recover the file from the Recycle Bin. But what if you don't catch it right away, or a program has deleted the file? Recuva to the rescue.\n\nRecuva is a small freeware program you can use to recover pictures, music, documents, videos, or any other types of files on your hard drive, memory cards, floppy disks, or USB sticks.\n\nUsually, when you or Windows delete a file, a lot of the file is left behind, even if you can't see it in Windows Explorer. Recuva scours your media (except CDs, DVDs and other optical media) and puts together the pieces so you can recover the files you need.\n\nRecuva also has the special ability to securely delete recovered files. For example, you may have deleted a sensitive document the regular way (emptying the Recycle Bin or highlighting the file and pressing the Delete key). \nThis type of deletion could let others recover the file. By using Recuva's restore-and-securely-delete functionality, you can make sure it's erased once and for all.\n\n\nRecuva can:\nScan through your hard drives, memory cards, and USB sticks to find files and folders you've deleted.\nTell you in advance how likely it is that your file(s) can be recovered.\nRecover files that Windows can't.\nSecurely delete a file you may have previously deleted.\nBring your files back!\n\nRecuva cannot:\nRecover all files. Yes, as great as Recuva is it won't work all the time. Sometimes Windows has overwritten the area where the file used to be, or sometimes the file is too corrupted to recover.\nRecover files you've deleted securely. For example, if you've used our CCleaner software to delete files using the Secure option, they're gone for good.\nSecurely delete certain very small files that are held in the Master File Table (MFT) and files of zero-byte length.\n\n\nLike all other Piriform products (including CCleaner), Recuva is free for both commercial and personal use.\n\n\n\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\nAdded 'Time remaining' indication to the progress dialog.\n\nAdded support for CRW (Canon RAW) files to the deep scan.\n\nFixed issue that could cause some FAT 32 files to not be securely deleted.\n\nImproved error handling.\n\nVarious UI changes.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6e58eef9e727064b071e6134c513cc5c97b2ee0","amp;dn":"Recuva+1.26.416","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6e58eef9e727064b071e6134c513cc5c97b2ee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,229,142,239,158,114,112,100,176,113,230,19,76,81,60,197,201,123,46,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
