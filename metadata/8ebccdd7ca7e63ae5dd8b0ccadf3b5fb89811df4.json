Utilizing cutting edge up-resing technology, Pyro FX makes it possible to create a low resolution simulation in planning out a shot, then increase the resolution on subsequent passes to add higher level of details and refinement. Pyro FX comes with several pre-made Pyro FX such as Billowy smoke and Fireball to give artists a head start when setting up a simulation.\n\nLighting artists can take advantage of the progressive Interactive Photorealistic Rendering (IPR) feature in Houdini 10. This IPR workflow supports both raytracing and Physically Based Rendering (PBR), providing feedback whenever a scene changes. An update will be triggered when shader and light parameters are tweaked or when objects, cameras and lights are added, moved or even removed. Artists can drag and drop materials into the IPR window and can ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcontrol clickÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to access shader parameters for any part of an image. Snap shots can be taken to compare with other iterations of a shot using features such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdiffingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nHoudini 10 also includes support for Stereoscopic 3D in both the viewport and HoudiniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s image viewer. The Houdini stereo camera supports both anaglyph and horizontal interlaced stereo and includes control for parallax and inter-axial distance. Studios can preview their 3D work from within Houdini and can generate stereo images at render time.\n\nHoudini 10 includes many more features such as:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢    Motion FX which gives artist-friendly access to the procedural power of HoudiniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s channel operators (CHOPS).\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢    Improvements to Network Usability including new align tools, and the ability to quickly connect and disconnect nodes using fewer clicks.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢    Physically Based Rendering (PBR) is now fully supported in HoudiniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s multi-threaded shading language.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢    Deep Camera Maps which make it possible to render volumes and objects into separate passes then combine them perfectly.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢    The Rigid Body Solver now supports ODE for faster simulations.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢    HoudiniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cloth solver can be used to simulate the Crumpling and Tearing of dentable and elastic surfaces.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢    The wire solver now supports Parting and is much faster when simulating longer wires.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢    New Knife and Edge Loop modeling tools.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ebccdd7ca7e63ae5dd8b0ccadf3b5fb89811df4","amp;dn":"Side+Effects+Houdini+master+10.0.249+32bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ebccdd7ca7e63ae5dd8b0ccadf3b5fb89811df4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,188,205,215,202,126,99,174,93,216,176,204,173,243,181,251,137,129,29,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
