He is searching for Delphine, who vanished with only a scrawled-out address on a scrap of paper as a trace.\n\nRichard Sala takes the tale of Snow White and stands it on its head, retelling it from Prince Charming's perspective (the unnamed traveler) in a contemporary setting. This twisted tale includes all the elements of terror from the original fairy tale, with none of the insipid saccharine coating of the Disney animated adaptation: Yes, there will be blood.\n\nOriginally serialized as part of the acclaimed international &quot;Ignatz&quot; series, Delphine is executed in a rich and ominous duotone that shows off Sala's virtuosity Ã¢â‚¬â€ punctuated with stunning full-color chapter breaks.\n\nAdvance praise from Booklist SalaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high-class horror sensibility is equal parts sinister and gleeful: a wild cackle of frights steeped in the grand gothic tradition of Edward GoreyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ SalaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quavery lines dish out plenty of unsettling images, and he ratchets up the eeriness with stylized, hand-drawn lettering. Though he sacrifices some narrative sense in favor of creepy atmospherics and downright baffling transitions, Sala does a fine job of keeping everything just slightly out of balance and off-kilter.
