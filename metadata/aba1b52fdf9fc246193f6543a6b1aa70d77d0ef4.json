Get it here!\n\nIt's suitable for anyone - if you've never tried DF before, or played for years - because while I've set up all the included parts already, the core is as easily accessible to you:  you can add, remove, update, replace whatever you want to and customise the pack as much as you want.  The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.\n\nChangelog:\n - Minor updates to Ironhand and Phoebus graphics\n - LNP subfolder names capitalised for consistency with OSX / Linux\n - re-added Legends Exports Processor v4.1; supports DF 40_09+, bugfixes\n** updated DF to 40_10\n - all graphics are still compatible, no no changes there\n - updated Dwarf Therapist to v25.0\n\nMD5: A042832499F0D2253963BA7506FF2614","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aba1b52fdf9fc246193f6543a6b1aa70d77d0ef4","amp;dn":"Dwarf+Fortress+40_10+Starter+Pack+r1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aba1b52fdf9fc246193f6543a6b1aa70d77d0ef4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,161,181,47,223,159,194,70,25,63,101,67,166,177,170,112,215,125,14,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
