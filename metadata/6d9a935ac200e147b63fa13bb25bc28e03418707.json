Game info and patch notes below and please help seed.\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nPostal: Classic and uncut (Patch notes)\n\n\nChangelog: \n\n\nWindows only change log \n\n\n- Left turn now works correctly when using the keyboard \n\n\n- Corpses no longer spin on the spot when they have died \n\n\n- Better-behaved game file handling (not writing to install dir, etc), \n\n\nWindows / Mac change log \n\n\n- Changed the controls from the arrows keys to the more standard WADS set up. \n\n\n- OpenGL and Direct3D support. This gives you a more consistent \nframerate, and more importantly, it lets you use overlays in games using \nchat clients such as Xfire and Raptr, and also makes recording the game \npossible using programs like Fraps. \n\n\n- Much better sound quality \n\n\n- The right and middle mouse buttons work now and can be configured in \nthe mouse input menu. \n\n\n- Basic game controller support \n\n\n- Lots of bug fixes. \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\n\nWhat's cool about it:\n\n- Includes the original POSTAL and the Special Delivery Expansion Pack\n- A fast-paced, guns-blazing, mind-numbing isometric view killing spree\n- Look at the world through the eyes of a psycho!\n\nOverview:\n\nBanned in over ten countries, realistic, non-stop-killing, action-strategy psychological thriller. No aliens, no mutants, no stupid quest for the dragon's balls. Just good antisocial, psychotic shoot-'em-up action, strategy and government intervention.\n\nBlast, maim and fire-bomb your way through 17 levels (plus 4 new levels and 24 new characters in the expansion pack). Exploit mass murder opportunities, mow down marching bands, spray protesters, charbroil whole towns. Enter multiplayer mode Go Postal with up to 15 other death row candidates.
