One track is a midtempo souful song called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cold Confession.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The song is pretty loose structure wise, it actually reminds me of the Mad Season songs that were released this year a bit sonically. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some really bluesy guitar riffs and an organ used that fills out the song sonically. Vedder sings, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMemory clear, cold confession that only he could hear.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other dark lines in the song like, Ã¢â‚¬ËœHe let himself scream/He let himself cry.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ The songs also references a dark past and dark future. The track clocks in at 5:46.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Let It RideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ actually reminds me of Riot Act, EdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s phrasing and singing style sounds very reminiscent of this period. Ed tells the story of a woman in the song, Ã¢â‚¬ËœLike a book with no ending/read backwards to beginning.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ He sings the refrain Ã¢â‚¬ËœSheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ before hitting the chorus, the song really picks up halfway through. The song is 4:16 long.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c63382bb3ad684d259e062807677fa9b4141686","amp;dn":"Pearl+Jam+2+songs+leaked+from+self+titled+album+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c63382bb3ad684d259e062807677fa9b4141686","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,99,56,43,179,173,104,77,37,158,6,40,7,103,127,169,180,20,22,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
