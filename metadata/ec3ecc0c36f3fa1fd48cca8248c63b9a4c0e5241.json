Cook desribes the music thusly, &quot;It&amp;#039;s certainly world music. Some people consider it a kaleidoscope of music of different cultures coming together. Every tune is like a kaleidoscope, you turn the lens and it forms a new picture. You shuffle things around a bit and suddenly you&amp;#039;ve created something new using often very old ancient music. You&amp;#039;re refocusing it by bringing together two forms of music that may have existed together on the planet for hundreds of years but have never been together in the same piece of music.&quot; Nomad was recorded in a number of studios the world over. //Enjoy this  great album","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec3ecc0c36f3fa1fd48cca8248c63b9a4c0e5241","amp;dn":"Jesse+Cook++-+Nomad+%5B2003%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec3ecc0c36f3fa1fd48cca8248c63b9a4c0e5241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,62,204,12,54,243,250,31,212,140,202,130,72,198,59,154,76,14,82,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
