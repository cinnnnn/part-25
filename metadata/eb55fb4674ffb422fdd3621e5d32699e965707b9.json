In the course of their first album, the band tells the story of a group of people fleeing a doomed Earth to settle on the planet KobaÃƒÂ¯a. Later, conflict arises when the KobaÃƒÂ¯ansÃ¢â‚¬â€descendants of the original colonistsÃ¢â‚¬â€encounter other Earth refugees.\n\n\n1. WatseÃƒÂ¯ kobaÃƒÂ¯a (4:40)\n2.

He thought he was better than anyone else and he was sure he could convert KobaÃƒÂ¯aÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enemies to the KobaÃƒÂ¯an spirit. But he failed and left alone for KobaÃƒÂ¯a. On the symbolic stop-over planet, Malaria, he has to face the raging elements he thinks he can dominate. With his ship almost sunk, he ends up begging themÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ to no avail. He will disappear. Drowned, swept away by the frenzied elements. After the noiseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ silence. At dawn, only a finally calmed remains, enlightened by the soft beams of the sun in this new day.\n\n\nThe original version of RÃƒÂ¯ah SahÃƒÂ¯ltaahk that was recorded in 1971 is featured on the album 1001Ã‚Â° Centigrade (vol. 2). But at the time, its composer, Christian Vander, was unhappy with the arrangement written by the group. This radically new version, adapted to suit the group's current line-up, is more faithful to the spirit of Magma's music and its uniquely weird and wonderful prog-rock style","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb55fb4674ffb422fdd3621e5d32699e965707b9","amp;dn":"Magma+-+R%26iuml%3Bah+Sah%26iuml%3Bltaahk+%5B2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb55fb4674ffb422fdd3621e5d32699e965707b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,85,251,70,116,255,180,34,253,211,98,30,93,50,105,158,150,87,7,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
