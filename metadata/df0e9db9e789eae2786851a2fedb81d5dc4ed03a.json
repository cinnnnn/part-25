Friends have died, Oa has been destroyed, and now he must say goodbye to Earth! As war threatens to dismantle the Green Lantern Corps, Hal does the unthinkable: He asks for help. Can he and a team of handpicked Lanterns remove a deadly weapon from the enemyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arsenal, or will they be dealt their first defeat? And what of Saint Walker, the fallen leader of the Blue Lanterns? Can the Corps survive without its most trusted and powerful ally?\n\nArt by: Billy Tan\nCover by: Billy Tan\nWritten by: Robert Venditti ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df0e9db9e789eae2786851a2fedb81d5dc4ed03a","amp;dn":"Green+Lantern+v5+029+%282014%29+%28Webrip%29+%28Two+covers%29+%28The+Last+Kryp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df0e9db9e789eae2786851a2fedb81d5dc4ed03a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,14,157,185,231,137,234,226,120,104,81,162,254,219,129,213,220,78,208,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
