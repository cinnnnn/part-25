An early version of &quot;Buffalo Stance&quot; appeared on the B-side of the Morgan McVey single &quot;Looking Good Diving&quot;. The single was not successful; however the B-side was re-recorded with Tim Simenon of Bomb the Bass fame and &quot;Buffalo Stance&quot; was born, becoming a worldwide hit reaching #3 in the UK, #3 in the Billboard Hot 100 and even reached #1 for two weeks in the Netherlands. The album also contained the #8 US (and #20 UK) hit &quot;Kisses on the Wind&quot; and the #5 UK hit &quot;Manchild&quot; (did not chart in the US).  The lyrics on the album are sometimes autobiographical, talking about school years. They are also influenced by Neneh's motherhood. Others speak of women allegedly trying to steal a man from another woman. All players and programmers are credited in this album, however Cameron McVey, Cherry's husband, appears as Booga Bear. Massive Attack's Robert Del Naja co-wrote &quot;Manchild&quot;, and fellow member Andrew Vowles aka DJ Mushroom performs on &quot;Kisses on the Wind&quot;, &quot;The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;So Here I Come&quot;. &quot;My Bitch&quot; is a vocal duet with Gilly G.  The cover and inner photos were shot by fashion photographer Jean-Baptiste Mondino..\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Buffalo Stance\n[02] Manchild\n[03] Kisses On The Wind\n[04] Inna City Mamma\n[05] The Next Generation\n[06] Love Ghetto\n[07] Heart\n[08] Phoney Ladies\n[09] OutrÃƒÂ© RisquÃƒÂ© Locomotive\n[10] So Here I Come\n[11] My Bitch\n[12] Heart (It's A Demo!)\n[13] Buffalo Stance (Sukka Mix)\n[14] Manchild (The Old School Mix)\n\nPlay Time - 01h:07m:18s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 452mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
