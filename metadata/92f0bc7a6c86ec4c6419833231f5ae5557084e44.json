This subject matter will transcend the issues of cultural relativism and traditional ideology and move to relate the core, empirical \\&quot;life ground\\&quot; attributes of human and social survival, extrapolating those immutable natural laws into a new sustainable social paradigm called a \\&quot;Resource-Based Economy\\&quot;\n\n\n====Zeitgeist Addendum (2008)==== &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1332128/plotsummary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1332128/plotsummary&lt;/a&gt;\nZeitgeist Addendum, attempts to locate the root causes of this pervasive social corruption, while offering a solution. This solution is not based on politics, morality, laws, or any other \\&quot;establishment\\&quot; notions of human affairs, but rather on a modern, non-superstitious based understanding of what we are and how we align with nature, to which we are a part. The work advocates a new social system which is updated to present day knowledge, highly influenced by the life long work of Jacque Fresco and The Venus Project. \n\n\n\n\nCompilation made by TZMau Chapter\nwww.zeitgeistaustralia.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92f0bc7a6c86ec4c6419833231f5ae5557084e44","amp;dn":"Zeitgeist+Addendum+%2B+Moving+Forward+%2B+Beyond+The+Pale+Trailer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92f0bc7a6c86ec4c6419833231f5ae5557084e44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,240,188,122,108,134,236,76,100,25,131,50,49,245,174,85,87,8,78,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
