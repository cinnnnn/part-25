Influenced by the likes of MotÃƒÂ¶rhead, Thin Lizzy and a range of Southern Rock and Blues Rock bands all the way from The Allman Brothers to ZZ Top, Los Bastardos Finlandeses aka &quot;The Boy Band from Hell&quot; has toured with Lemmy and company as well as Aerosmith and Deep Purple.\n\n\nLos Bastardos FinlandesesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..BAD MOTHERFUCKERÃ‚Â´S BALL! (2015)\n\n\nThe four amigoÃ‚Â´s from Helsinki Rock City are still doing their damnedest best for the future of good old rock n roll! Their new album, BMF BALL is Ã¢â‚¬Å“in the canÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ even before their last album Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Day Of The Dead Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ has had its long Ã¢â‚¬â€œ awaited German release! So much procrastination at the business table fueled the Bastardos back into the studio to vent a spleen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the result ?  ..Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad MotherfuckerÃ‚Â´s Ball Ã¢â‚¬Å“.\n\n\nPure and tasty Rock n Roll brewed and bottled in Finland! The title track was immediately picked up by Radio Rock as their official beer opening song for the summer. (The second time in three years they have chosen a track from LBF).\n\nBastardos have been around since 2007 and this will be their sixth album. Its the third cd with the current line up which includes guitarist Ben Granfelt and Twist Twist Eerkinharju on drums, who both featured in the legendary Leningrad Cowboys line-up back in the 90Ã‚Â´s. Ben Granfelt then joined Wishbone Ash for four years whilst Twist Twist played in Peer Gunt, FinlandÃ‚Â´s premier hard rock trio! Bryn Jones, from Wales, is playing bass and singing lead vocals and Olli KykkÃƒÂ¤nen is the bandÃ‚Â´s rhythm guitarist and main songwriter. They call it Ã‚Â´Motor Rock!` Drummer, Twist Twist El Grande is the BMF powering the whole show, whilst Ben Ã¢â‚¬Å“El GringoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Granfelt breaks out some atmospheric twang Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar as well as rocking out on his Flying-V. Don Osmo is writing the riffs on his very own Lucille 335 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a la BB King and bassist/vocalist Bryn El Taff Bastardo still sounds like heÃ‚Â´s swallowing razor blades and chasing them down with whisky.\n\n\nLBF have toured with Aerosmith and Motorhead and opened up for the likes of Metallica, Deep Purple, ZZ Top and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Whilst touring in Scandinavia, UK and Europe they have released five albums and built up a loyal fan base. Their videos are popular on You Tube and Finnish Radio Rock and Radio City are supporting and promoting the band. Next stop UK. and Germany!\n\nLine-Up:\nEl Bastardo Grande: Drums\nDon Osmo: Guitar\nEl Taff Bastardo: Vocals\nEl Muerte: Bass\nEl Diablo: Guitar\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscography:\n2007 -- My Name Is El Muerte\n2008 -- Return of El Diablo\n2009 -- El Grande's Saloon\n2011 -- Saved By RockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Roll\n2013 -- Day Of The Dead\n2015 -- BMF Ball (2015)\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
