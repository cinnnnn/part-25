This is where the frail young Van Humphries must goÃ¢â‚¬â€or die trying.\n\nYears before, VanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s older brother perished in the first attempt to land a man on Venus. VanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father has always hated him for being the one to survive. Now, his father is offering a $10-billion prize to the first person who lands on Venus and returns his oldest sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remains. To everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surprise, Van takes up the offer. But what Van Humphries will find on Venus will change everythingÃ¢â‚¬â€our understanding of Venus, of global warming on Earth, and his knowledge of who he is.\n\n\nNarrated by: Stefan Rudnicki\nLength: 11 hrs and 24 mins \nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:02-04-11\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59f28c88a406369791fb6a4ab9a7d7964012acd1","amp;dn":"Ben+Bova+-+Venus+%28The+Grand+Tour+%2317%29+%5BAUDIBLE+RIP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59f28c88a406369791fb6a4ab9a7d7964012acd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,242,140,136,164,6,54,151,145,251,106,74,185,167,215,150,64,18,172,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
