Higgins's acclaimed novel The Friends Of Eddie Coyle. World-weary and living hand to mouth, Coyle works on the sidelines of the seedy Boston underworld just to make ends meet. But when he finds himself facing a second stretch of hard time, he's forced to weigh loyalty to his criminal colleagues against snitching to stay free. Directed with a sharp eye for its gritty locales and an open heart for its less-than-heroic characters, this is one of the true treasures of 1970s Hollywood filmmaking - a suspenseful crime drama in stark, unforgiving daylight.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nNew, restored high-definition digital transfer, approved by director Peter Yates\nAudio commentary featuring Yates\nStills gallery \n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
