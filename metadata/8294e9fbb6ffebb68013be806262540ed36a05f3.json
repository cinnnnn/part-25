Readers learn how they can dump Microsoft products--even the Windows operating system--and continue to be productive. The book also shows how to work successfully and seamlessly with computers and people who are still hooked on Microsoft software. Includes full explanations of alternate operating systems, such as Linux and Mac, and outlines various software applications that can replace the familiar Microsoft products.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8294e9fbb6ffebb68013be806262540ed36a05f3","amp;dn":"Just+Say+No+To+Microsoft","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8294e9fbb6ffebb68013be806262540ed36a05f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,148,233,251,182,255,235,182,128,19,190,128,98,98,84,14,211,106,5,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
