The Ultimate Nap is a peaceful musical soundtrack with embedded brainwave pulses, based on 25 years of research.\n\nResearch has shown that regular napping can decrease stress, increase our ability to learn and work efficiently, enhance creativity, and improve our overall health. Simply listen to this clinically proven musical system anytime to experience the ultimate nap.\n\nThe Ultimate Nap CD Story\n\nDr. Jeffrey Thompson has crafted a unique napping system that quickly takes you from a stressed and alert state to a deeply recuperative nap-sleep state. The pioneering research behind this audio CD is based on a multi-hospital program Dr. Thompson developed for nurses who had only 10 minutes during their short breaks from high-stress work to rest, relax, and renew.\n\n- Based on 25 years of clinical research\n- Choose from 10, 20, and 30 minute programs\n- Each nap program ends with soft chimes to gently awaken you\n- Use with any ordinary speakers or light headphones\n- Contains no spoken words or subliminal messages\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nThe Ultimate Nap CD uses clinically proven techniques to help you experience the Ã¢â‚¬Å“perfect nap.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ As we enter a sleeping or napping state, our brainwave patterns change. To help you achieve this napping state, Dr. Thompson utilizes a unique audio process known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“brainwave entrainment.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Specific brainwave pulses embedded into this soothing musical soundtrack cause your own brainwaves to Ã¢â‚¬Å“lockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ onto these pulses, leading you quickly and easily into a rejuvenating nap.\n\nHow to Use this Recording\n\nIt is optimal to experience this audio program using stereo sound. You can do this by placing speakers on either side of you, by using a stereo sound pillow, or by using very light headphones.\n\nPlay this nap recording at the volume that works best for you. For some people this audio program will work at barely discernible levels, while others may find louder volumes work best.\n\nWhen you want to take a nap, choose either the 10, 20, or 30 minute program and simply let the music wash over you. Relax your body, quiet your mind, and let the music do the rest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d41a9c98eb1cb26e73f49f9cc12e3b360a8ee789","amp;dn":"Dr.+Jeffrey+Thompson+-+The+Ultimate+Nap+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d41a9c98eb1cb26e73f49f9cc12e3b360a8ee789","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,26,156,152,235,28,178,110,115,244,159,156,193,46,59,54,10,142,231,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
