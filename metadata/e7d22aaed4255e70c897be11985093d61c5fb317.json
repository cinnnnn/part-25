It demonstrates, over the course of seven discs and\nseven hours, how critical each member of that quintet was. As the group coalesces\nover a period of two years it's tangible how everything falls into place, like a set of\ntumblers on a complicated lock.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nMiles Davis (trumpet), Ron Carter (bass), George Coleman (tenor saxophone on\ndiscs 1-5), Victor Feldman (piano on disc 1), Frank Butler (drums on disc 1), Herbie\nHancock (piano on discs 2-7), Tony Williams (drums on discs 2-7), Sam Rivers\n(tenor saxophone on disc 6), Wayne Shorter (tenor saxophone on disc 7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
