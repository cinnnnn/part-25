Looking to form a \\&quot;top gun rock band\\&quot; based on the concept of dual lead guitars, Prince and Cox recruited Todd Potter; a gymnast, saxophone player and guitarist. With the addition of Danny Segovia, the original line up of Bubble Puppy was complete. Bubble Puppy\\&amp;#039;s live debut was as the opening act for The Who in San Antonio.\n\nAfter several line-up changes, the final roster for Bubble Puppy settled at Rod Prince and Todd Potter on lead guitars, Roy Cox on bass guitar and David \\&quot;Fuzzy\\&quot; Fore on drums. In 1967, Bubble Puppy moved to Austin, Texas and signed a recording contract with Houston-based International Artists, home to the 13th Floor Elevators and the Red Krayola.\n\nBubble Puppy scored a Top-20 U.S. hit in 1969 with their single, \\&quot;Hot Smoke &amp; Sassafras\\&quot;; it peaked at number 14 on the Billboard 100.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ffac9d81eb3db0f9e3bbfe94e5c32ddb352fa8c","amp;dn":"Bubble+Puppy+--+A+Gathering+of+Promises","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ffac9d81eb3db0f9e3bbfe94e5c32ddb352fa8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,250,201,216,30,179,219,15,158,59,191,233,78,92,50,221,179,82,250,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
