In histories of art, this period of unprecedented complexity has generally been divided into the two presumably antagonistic categories of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, a black-and-white polarity that, in more refined histories, also permits a single shade of gray called Romantic Classicism. With closer scrutiny, these semantic straitjackets, like the term Mannerism, have become impossible either to live with or to live without. What are we to call those strange new emotions we feel welling in so much late eighteenth century art, if not Romanticism? What are we to call that abundance of works newly inspired by Greco-Roman art, history, and mythology, if not Neoclassicism?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8841910add89cb43e077e91ae84273af52fdf3d8","amp;dn":"Transformations+in+Late+Eighteenth+Century+Art+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8841910add89cb43e077e91ae84273af52fdf3d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,65,145,10,221,137,203,67,224,119,233,26,232,66,115,175,82,253,243,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
