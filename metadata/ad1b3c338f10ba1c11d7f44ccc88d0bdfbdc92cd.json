On the PC platform it is entirely in MIDI format. On the Macintosh, Interplay used digital music for the soundtrack: Professional Studio Mixes of the best of the PC soundtrack with guitars, drums, etc. . That soundtrack is a must-have for everybody who loves the Descent PC soundtrack.&quot; -- http://www.descent2.com/\n\nHere is the CDA rip of the Mac release of the game.
