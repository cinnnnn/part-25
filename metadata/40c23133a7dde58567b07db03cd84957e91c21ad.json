Already filled to the brim with content, the Aion: Ascension free-to-play update introduces mounts, non-instanced player housing, furniture crafting, over 600 new quests, new zones, new instances, improved graphics, NVIDIA-exclusive features, and much much more. Unlike many other free-to-play massively multiplayer online role-playing games, Aion is truly free, giving players unrestricted access to all of the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s content, classes, items, and player levels. Furthermore, Ascension introduces the Atreian Atlus, lowering the barrier of entry for newcomers by offering tips, strategy guides, walkthroughs, and instructional videos, in addition to a personalized roadmap displaying accomplishments and what lies ahead. As you can see in the videos and images, accessible through the navigation bar on the left, Aion looks fantastic, having received a significant graphics upgrade in 2011. Ascension introduces a few further tweaks and enhancements, but more importantly includes full NVIDIA 3D Vision and NVIDIA Surround support, giving players a high-fidelity experience. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for something new to play itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard not to recommend Aion Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s free, it looks fantastic, the gameplay is polished to a tee following several years of updates, and other players donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t receive competitive advantages if they choose to spend real money.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40c23133a7dde58567b07db03cd84957e91c21ad","amp;dn":"Soul-Aion+4.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40c23133a7dde58567b07db03cd84957e91c21ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,194,49,51,167,221,229,133,103,176,125,176,60,216,73,87,233,28,33,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
