He emphasizes the varying nature of sectoral adjustment behaviors, in response to shocks and policies, and the changes in policies to deal with external shocks over time. The structural reforms implemented after 1985 show the supreme effort the country has made to apply coherent economic policies after a long period of indebtedness and crisis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3108ca4169043f40aa3b6465d324931417ba89f9","amp;dn":"Debt%2C+Crisis+and+Reform+in+Bolivia%3A+Biting+the+Bullet+%28Internati","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3108ca4169043f40aa3b6465d324931417ba89f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,8,202,65,105,4,63,64,170,59,100,101,211,36,147,20,23,186,137,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
