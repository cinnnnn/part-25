Global responsibility requires a comprehensive integration of sustainable development fostered by new paradigms, innovative technologies, methods and tools as well as business models. Minimizing material and energy usage, adapting material and energy flows to better fit natural process capacities, and changing consumption behaviour are important aspects of future production. A life cycle perspective and an integrated economic, ecological and social evaluation are essential requirements in management and engineering. This series will focus on the issues and latest developments towards sustainability in production based on life cycle thinking","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c69c9b700774b708716d27e2ea92c378bb96786","amp;dn":"Sustainable+Production%2C+Life+Cycle+Engineering+and+Management","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c69c9b700774b708716d27e2ea92c378bb96786","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,105,201,183,0,119,75,112,135,22,210,126,46,169,44,55,139,185,103,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
