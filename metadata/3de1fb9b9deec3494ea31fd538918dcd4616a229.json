Back in the free and illegal flow of information after a year without it, Pirate and Information are almost overwhelmed, but that&amp;#039;s ok. It&amp;#039;s part of the high. Technograph visits the old people in the desert outside the city, and a whale passes through the City&amp;#039;s airspace.\n\nThis all leads up to an event of great importance for the resistance. It is the beginning of something new. A seed for the future.\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â»Mattias Elftorp&amp;#039;s stories are dark, nervy, fine, and edgy,\nas is his artwork. However as dark as the post-apocalyptic world\nhe envisions appears to be, it is a world full of promise.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«\nCarol Swain\n\n72 pgs \nb/w \n\nSample pages: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.elftorp.com/freeinformation/pir002sample.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.elftorp.com/freeinformation/pir002sample.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---\nPIRACY IS LIBERATION 001: Information Wants to be Free &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3905072/Piracy_is_Liberation_001__Information_Wants_to_be_Free&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3905072/Piracy_is_Liberation_001__Information_Wants_to_be_Free&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3de1fb9b9deec3494ea31fd538918dcd4616a229","amp;dn":"Piracy+is+Liberation+002%3A+Infotrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3de1fb9b9deec3494ea31fd538918dcd4616a229","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,225,251,155,157,238,195,73,78,163,31,213,56,145,141,205,70,22,162,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
