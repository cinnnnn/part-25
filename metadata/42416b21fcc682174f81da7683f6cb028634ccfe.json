Sticking to a mix of standards and popular songs that have since fallen out of favor among jazz musicians, the pianist and his longtime alto saxophonist, Paul Desmond, weave their magic together with several extended imaginative improvisations, particularly &quot;On the Alamo&quot; and &quot;Gone with the Wind.&quot; The campy pseudo-newspaper packaging adds to the appeal of this long unavailable record, which still pops up occasionally in used record stores nearly five decades after it was recorded. ~ Ken Dryden \n\nDave Brubeck - Dave Brubeck at Storyville Tracks:\n01  On the Alamo 10:43 \n02  Don't Worry 'Bout Me 6:50 \n03  Here Lies Love 5:48 \n04  Gone with the Wind 8:15 \n05  When You're Smiling (The Whole World Smiles with You) 9:50 \n06  Back Bay Blues 6:28 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42416b21fcc682174f81da7683f6cb028634ccfe","amp;dn":"Dave+Brubeck+-+Dave+Brubeck+Storyville+%281954%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bflac%5D%5Bschon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42416b21fcc682174f81da7683f6cb028634ccfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,65,107,33,252,198,130,23,79,129,218,118,131,246,203,2,134,52,204,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
