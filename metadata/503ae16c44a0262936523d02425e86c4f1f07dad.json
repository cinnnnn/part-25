Known for twin lead guitars, a wide operatic vocal style, and for introducing the S&amp;M leather-and-studs look into heavy metal, they have sold over 50 million albums worldwide.After an early career as a secondary act dogged by unsympathetic producers and lineup changes, the band found considerable commercial success in the 1980s. The band's membership has seen much turnover, including a revolving cast of drummers in the 1970s, and the temporary resignation of singer Rob Halford in the early 1990s. The current line-up consists of lead vocalist Rob Halford, guitarists Glenn Tipton and Richie Faulkner, bassist Ian Hill, and drummer Scott Travis. In 2010, the band announced a farewell world tour, and a new album is expected to be released sometime in 2013.\nThis is the first bootleg to surface from the Epitaph World Tour, the last major world tour the band is going to go through. It is special in many ways, which I'll explain.\nFirst proper show with Richie Faulkner. First show of the Epitaph Tour. Live versions of Never Satisfied and Blood Red Skies. Starbreaker performed for the first time in 31 years.\n\nArtist        :  Judas Priest\nDate          :  June 7 2011\nVenue         :  013 Dommolsch zaal\nCity          :  Tilburg\nCountry       :  Holland\nRecorded by   :  a fan\nEquipment     :  md sony MZ-NH700 with Core Sound Binaural Microphones &amp;\n                 Switchable Bass Roll-off Filter\nRecording is  :  Audience\n\n\nSony MD MZ-NH700 with Core Sound Binaural microphones &amp; Switchable Bass Filter on ==&gt; Sonicstage ==&gt; Traders Little Helper ==&gt; flac\n\n\nTracks(2:01:57)\nRapid Fire\nMetal Gods\nHeading Out to the Highway\nJudas Rising\nStarbreaker\nVictim of Changes\nNever Satisfied\nDiamonds and Rust\nProphecy\nNight Crawler\nTurbo Lover\nBeyond the Realms of Death\nThe Sentinel\nBlood Red Skies\nThe Green Manalishi\nBreaking the Law\nPainkiller\nThe Hellion/Electric Eye\nHell Bent for Leather\nYou've Got Another Thing Comin'\n\nBand\nRob Halford - Vocals\nGlenn Tipton - Guitar\nRichie Faulkner - Guitar\nIan Hill - Bass\nScott Travis - Drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:503ae16c44a0262936523d02425e86c4f1f07dad","amp;dn":"Judas+Priest-+Blood+Red+Epitaph-2011+Bootleg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"503ae16c44a0262936523d02425e86c4f1f07dad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,58,225,108,68,160,38,41,54,82,61,2,66,94,134,196,241,240,125,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
