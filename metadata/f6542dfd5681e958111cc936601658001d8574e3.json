The recording of the DVD spans the years from 1969 to 1979 and includes performances from the Royal Albert Hall in 1970, Madison Square Garden in 1973, Earls Court in 1975, and Knebworth in 1979, plus other footage. The DVD was released in the United Kingdom on May 26, 2003 and the United States on May 27, 2003. Bootleg footage from some of the concerts is interspersed with the professionally shot material. Led Zeppelin guitarist, and producer of the DVD, Jimmy Page, put out an open request for bootleg footage for specific concert dates to bootleg traders, many of whom complied.\n\nMuch of the footage was painstakingly restored for almost a year. Some of the video tapes were so old and brittle, they had to be baked in ovens in order to regain their flexibility. The audio portions were digitally remixed for stereo and 5.1 surround mixes.\n\nThe RIAA certified the Led Zeppelin DVD at 22 times platinum for 1.1 million sales in the United States alone (2.5 million worldwide). It was, for three years the highest selling music DVD in America. As of November 2007, the DVD has had an overwhelmingly positive number of reviews on website Amazon, with 560 out of 618 reviewers giving it five stars.\nUpon its release the DVD received excellent reviews. Michael Azerrad of Rolling Stone magazine gave the DVD four (out of four) stars, describing it as the \\&quot;Holy Grail of heavy metal\\&quot; and \\&quot;one of the best rock documentaries ever made.\\&quot;\n\nLed Zeppelin DVD Boxset (Disc 1: MP4 Disc @: Avi)\n\n\nPlease Seed to the max!!\n\nPlease comment on audio/video quality\t\n\n\nGenre:Live Performance \nIMDB:imdb.com/title/tt0366707/dvd \nRating:9.3 \nLanguage: English \n\n\nPlaylist:\n\nDisc 1 \nWe\\'re Gonna Groove/ I Can\\'t Quit You Babe/ Dazed And Confused/ White Summer/ What Is And What Should Never Be/ The Ocean/ How Many More Times/ Moby Dick/ Whole Lotta Love/ Communication Breakdown/ C\\'mon Everybody/ Something Else/ Bring It On Home \n\nDisc 2 \nImmigrant Song/ Black Dog/ Misty Mountain Hop/ Since I\\'ve Been Loving You/ Going To California/ That\\'s The Way/ Bron-Y-Aur Stomp/ In My Time Of Dying/ Trampled Underfoot/ Stairway To Heaven/ Rock And Roll/ Nobody\\'s Fault But Mine/ Sick Again/ Achilles Last Stand/ In The Evening/ Kashmir/ Whole Lotta Love ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6542dfd5681e958111cc936601658001d8574e3","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+DVD+Boxset+%282003%29+Perfect+Audio%2FVideo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6542dfd5681e958111cc936601658001d8574e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,84,45,253,86,129,233,88,17,28,201,54,96,22,88,0,29,133,116,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
