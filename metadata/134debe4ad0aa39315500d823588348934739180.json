Its members include Detective Olivia Benson, herself the child of a rape, Detective Elliot Stabler, a family man trying to protect his family from the horrors of the world, Detective John Munch, a cynical ex-Baltimore homicide detective beginning a new life in New York, Detective Fin Tutuola, a streetwise cop from the Hood, and Captain Donald Cragen, their boss. The crimes they deal with are painful, emotional, disturbing, horrific and scarring - and every day there's more of the same... These are their stories.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:134debe4ad0aa39315500d823588348934739180","amp;dn":"Law%26Order+SVU+Seasons+1-8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"134debe4ad0aa39315500d823588348934739180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,77,235,228,173,10,163,147,21,80,13,130,53,136,52,137,52,115,145,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
