Produced by Louisiana blues guitar-slinger Tab Benoit,\nÃƒÂ¶SOHOÃƒÂ¶ members J.P. Soars, Damon Fowler and Victor Wainwright, have followed a\nswampy gumbo recipe reminiscent of classic southern rockers Little Feat (during\nthe Lowell George years) with a selection ranging from soul-inflected blues, to\ncountry, to jazz, to straight-ahead rock.\n\nSOHOFowler, who hails from Brandon, Florida, had produced three self-released\nalbums beginning in 1999 before signing with Blind Pig Records, which released\nSugar Shack in 2009 and Devil Got His Way in 2011.  Fowler is a guitarist with\na\npassion for lap steel and Dobro.\n\nSoars gained attention in 2009 when his band won the Blues FoundationÃƒâ€ s\nInternational Blues Challenge and he won the Albert King Award as the best\nguitarist.  Originally from Arkansas, Soars moved to Florida during his teens,\nand spent six years playing in death metal bands.\n\nWainwright, who adds his swampy, boogie-woogie keyboards to the mixture, grew\nup\nin Savannah, Georgia and moved to Daytona Beach, Florida to attend college.  He\nworked as an air-traffic controller for several years in Memphis, continued to\nplay music, and managed to release three albums.\n\nSOHO came about in July 2011 when the three musicians, separately performing at\na music festival in Florida, had an impromptu jam session.  The trio was joined\non Easy LivinÃƒâ€  by Chuck Riley on bass and Chris Peet on drums.\n\nThe bandÃƒâ€ s first offering begins with a funky, swampy ÃƒÂ´Southern LivinÃƒâ€ ÃƒÂ¶ penned\nby the band members and Benoit.  SoarsÃƒâ€  ÃƒÂ´Long Way HomeÃƒÂ¶ is a beefy blues\nrocker,\nwhich is followed by FowlerÃƒâ€ s laid-back soul ÃƒÂ´Kind Lies &amp; Whiskey,ÃƒÂ¶ SoarsÃƒâ€ \nÃƒÂ¶Mile\nAfter MileÃƒÂ¶ with its Smokey-and-the-Bandit twang, and WainwrightÃƒâ€ s cool soul\nÃƒÂ´Certified Lover.ÃƒÂ¶  Willie Bobo and Melvin C. LastieÃƒâ€ s classic instrumental\nÃƒÂ´Fried Neckbonds and Home Fries,ÃƒÂ¶ made famous with rock audiences by Santana,\nis\none of only two covers in the collection.  The musicianship on the release is\nsolid, and the song selection is an appealing variety.  Check out FowlerÃƒâ€ s\nÃƒÂ´DonÃƒâ€ t Feel Like Going There TodayÃƒÂ¶ and ÃƒÂ´Sky is What I BreatheÃƒÂ¶ to see the\nrange\nof songwriting these guys are putting together.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82238af0eec01dddc3d20d5fa70fd2bcb7efb1fe","amp;dn":"Southern_Hospitality-Easy_Livin-2013-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82238af0eec01dddc3d20d5fa70fd2bcb7efb1fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,35,138,240,238,192,29,221,195,210,13,95,167,15,210,188,183,239,177,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
