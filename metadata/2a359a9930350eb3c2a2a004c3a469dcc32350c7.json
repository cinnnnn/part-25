It was taken from the C-5M Supergalaxy by Area 51 since these two planes are more or less similar (size apart). I tweaked a few files in order to use this VC on the C-17 Globemaster, that means that the eyepoint is much higher than it should be. Bear with it.\n\n\n\nThis is a temporary solution while waiting for Alphasim's release of the proper cockpit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a359a9930350eb3c2a2a004c3a469dcc32350c7","amp;dn":"FSX+Virtual+Cockpit+for+C-17+Globemaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a359a9930350eb3c2a2a004c3a469dcc32350c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,53,154,153,48,53,14,179,194,162,160,4,195,164,105,220,195,35,80,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
