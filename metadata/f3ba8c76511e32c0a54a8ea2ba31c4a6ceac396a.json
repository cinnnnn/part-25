The album was released in 1989 and included the songs &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; and &quot;Claudette&quot; that because of time constraints had been deleted from the televised broadcast. However it did not include the song &quot;Blue Angel&quot; which was cut from the original broadcast for the same reason.\n\nOn piano was Glen D. Hardin, who had played piano for Buddy Holly as well as Elvis Presley. Lead guitarist James Burton, drummer Ronnie Tutt and bassist Jerry Scheff were also from Presley's group.
