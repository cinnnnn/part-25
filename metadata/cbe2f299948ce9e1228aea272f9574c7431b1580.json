Born on a farm in a small town in Missouri, Mr. Bulla's first school was a one-room country schoolhouse. One day his teacher asked each first grade student what he or she would do with a thousand dollars. Young Clyde answered that he would buy a table. His classmates laughed heartily, and his teacher was puzzled. Ã¢â‚¬Å“What I really meant,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Mr. Bulla, Ã¢â‚¬Å“is a desk or other flat surface on which to write my stories!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\n\n                    Title 1: SHOESHINE GIRL\n\nby Clyde Robert Bulla, Illustrated by Jim Burke\n\n\nWho ever heard of a shoeshine girl?\n\nThe last thing Sarah Ida wants to do is spend the summer with her Aunt Claudia.

Peace reigned in the castle until the fearsome night when Lionel, long-lost brother of Lord Weldon, returned to cause trouble and unhappiness.\n\nIt was then that Shan, the son of Lord Weldon, took on the duties of a knight and hid the sword in the hollow of the giant oak. The days that followed were filled with adventures that tried the courage of the young boy.\n\nShan was surprised by bearded robbers in the woods. He met noble knights in plumed helmets, and eventually he even made a trip to high-towered Camelot. His story is filled with the pageantry and color of England in King Arthur's time. It creates a vivid picture of the Knights of the Round Table and the wisdom of King Arthur himself.\n\nMr. Bulla captures the spirit of those romantic days in a straightforward, exciting manner. The result is another delightful book for his wide audience of young readers. Paul Galdone's vigorous illustrations are as evocative as the text.\n\n\nProduct Details:\n\nFile Size: epub 3.5 Mb, mobi 3.08 Mb\nE-Edition: May 2013\nISBN-13: 9780062290656\n\n\n\n                    Title 4: A LION TO GUARD US\n\nby Clyde Robert Bulla, Illustrated by Michele Chessare\n\n\nAmanda Freebold doesn't know what to do.
