This sequel follows in its footsteps with a selection of 46 classics of American traditional music recorded in the 1920s (on 2 CDs ) - many of them are among the great iconic performances of the whole genre, including selections by legendary performers like Bukka White, Charley Patton, Dennis McGee, Eck Robertson, Ishman Bracey, Uncle Dave Macon, and many, many more. Included is a 54 page booklet that tracks the history of collecting old 78 records from its beginning in the 1920s thru the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brought to life by countless first hand recollections by pioneer collectors themselves and recounts their fascinating experiences. The booklet is also full of rare graphics which add another intriguing dimension. Like last time the 2 CDs are packaged in an oversize DVD digipack format and cover art is by famous illustrator Drew Friedman. The sound quality represents a new high standard even for Yazoo which has always been known for great remastered sound Ã¢â‚¬â€œ many tracks sound like modern recordings with the performer right there in the room with you.\n\n-Shanachie Entertainment\n\nCD 1\n1.
