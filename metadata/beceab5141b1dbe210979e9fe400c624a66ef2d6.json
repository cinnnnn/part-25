This is the fixed upload.  When I first uploaded,\nI made the torrent with the wav files included.  (I had test copied\nthe files and then forgot to delete the wav files afterward.  Sorry\nfor the confusion.)\n\nA great covers cd.  \n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nI Am Sam is the soundtrack to the 2001 film I Am Sam. It was released on January 8, 2002 by V2 Records. The album is notable for including cover versions of songs by The Beatles (exclusively), although originally it was intended to comprise the original recordings by the group. When Sean Penn was unable to obtain the rights to include the songs, he commissioned the artists featured on the album to record the versions released.\n\nThe disc was ripped to flac using EAC.  The upload includes \ncue sheet, log file, playlist and artwork.  Enjoy.\n\nFor more on flac:\nsourceforge.net\ndbpoweramp.com\nexactaudiocopy.de\n\n01-Two Of Us [Aimee Mann &amp; Michael Penn]  3:30\n02-Blackbird [Sarah McLachlan]  2:21\n03-Across The Universe [Rufus Wainwright]  4:08\n04-I'm Looking Through You [The Wallflowers]  2:39\n05-You've Got To Hide Your Love Away [Eddie Vedder]  2:09\n06-Strawberry Fields Forever [Ben Harper]  4:26\n07-Mother Nature's Son [Sheryl Crow]  2:42\n08-Golden Slumbers [Ben Folds]  1:41\n09-I'm Only Sleeping [The Vines]  3:05\n10-Don't Let Me Down [Stereophonics]  4:08\n11-Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds [The Black Crowes]  3:50\n12-Julia [Chocolate Genius]  4:34\n13-We Can Work It Out [Heather Nova]  2:15\n14-Help!
