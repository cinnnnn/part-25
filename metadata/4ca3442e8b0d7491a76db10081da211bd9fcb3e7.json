If our game leaves any scars, we hope you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be able to see them. \n\nYou play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at EthanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into.\n\n==============================\nFeatures RePack: \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Do not cut | Do not recoded \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Multi-language - MULTI6 Languages \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Game Version - v.1.0 \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ DLC content: \nÃ‚Â»The Vanishing of Ethan Carter - Digital Poster \nÃ‚Â»The Vanishing of Ethan Carter - Making of Album \nÃ‚Â»The Vanishing of Ethan Carter - Original Soundtrack \nÃ‚Â»The Vanishing of Ethan Carter - Red Crek Valley Map \nÃ‚Â»The Vanishing of Ethan Carter - Wallpapers \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Installation time ~ 5-7 minutes. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ RePack by MAXAGENT\n\nFountainhead - GAMES MEGA TORRENTS - GMT-MAX ORG\nGames for English and Russian audience\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ca3442e8b0d7491a76db10081da211bd9fcb3e7","amp;dn":"The+Vanishing+of+Ethan+Carter+%2B+5+DLC+RePack+MAXAGENT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ca3442e8b0d7491a76db10081da211bd9fcb3e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,163,68,46,139,13,116,145,167,109,177,0,129,218,33,27,217,252,179,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
