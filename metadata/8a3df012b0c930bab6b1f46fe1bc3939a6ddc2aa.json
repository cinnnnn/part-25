Instrumental hits from mid century. Listen closely and you can see how this influenced rock that emerged on its heels. The talent is undeniable from sax players to finger picking those guitars. Surf guitar can even be heard. Many songs are Latin which is very surprising but also tells us how important Latin music was. Remember I Love Lucy and her husband? Ricky was Cuban and Americans expected Latin musicians in the clubs because it was some great dancing music.\r\n\r\nNow about your grandmother...she was rocking these jams in her tight stretchy pants and getting hot and heavy on the dance floor. She was free spirited and partied like it was 1899. I'm not calling her a hussy but I will say she was hot and her rumbling in the backseat of that car is the reason you exist today. So when you listen to this music think about grandma getting wet and getting it on lol\r\n\r\n- Big Papi\r\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/lovHY08ytx.jpg[/img]\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n 25 All-Time Greatest Recordings\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nArtist...............: Various Artists\r\nAlbum................: \r\nGenre................: Instrumental\r\nSource...............: CD\r\nYear.................: 2000\r\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\r\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\r\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\r\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\r\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Tracklisting\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n 1.
