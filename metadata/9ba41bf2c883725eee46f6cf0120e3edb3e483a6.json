The Savant syndrome is so rare that only 200 cases have been documented in this country. \n\nReaders will share the author's feelings of bewildered awe as they meet the &quot;extraordinary people&quot; and the families who help the phenomenally gifted, but otherwise cruelly deprived, savants in music, art, math and feats of memory impossible for the rest of the population.'\n\nThis is a .Djvu file and requires a Djvu viewer, which is freeware and can be downloaded here:\nhttp://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Other-Office-Tools/WinDjView.shtml (it's frreeware)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ba41bf2c883725eee46f6cf0120e3edb3e483a6","amp;dn":"Extraordinary+People%3A+Understanding+Idiot+Savants.djvu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ba41bf2c883725eee46f6cf0120e3edb3e483a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,164,27,242,200,131,114,94,238,70,246,207,1,32,227,237,179,228,131,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
