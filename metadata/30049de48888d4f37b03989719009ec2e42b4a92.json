It was recorded in late 1966 and released on Colgems label #102 on January 9, 1967. It displaced the band's debut album from the top of the Billboard 200 chart and remained at No.1 for 18 weeksÃ¢â‚¬â€the longest of any Monkees album. Combined, the first two Monkees albums were at the top of the Billboard chart for 31 consecutive weeks. More of the Monkees also went to No.1 in the UK. In the U.S. it has been certified quintuple platinum by the RIAA with sales of more than five million copies. \n\nMonkeemania had reached full swing by the time the album was released. The Monkees' second single, &quot;I'm a Believer&quot; (included on this album) held the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 and they were about to embark on a highly successful concert tour. \n\nThe Monkees were an American pop band that released music under their original incarnation between 1966 and 1970, with subsequent reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. Assembled in Los Angeles in 1965 by Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1968, the musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork, and Englishman Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner. \n\nDescribed by band member Micky Dolenz as initially being &quot;a TV show about an imaginary band [...] that wanted to be The Beatles, [but] that was never successful&quot;, the actor-musicians soon became a real band. As Dolenz would later describe it, &quot;The Monkees really becoming a band was like the equivalent of Leonard Nimoy really becoming a Vulcan.&quot; \n\nFor the first few months of their almost five-year initial career, the four actor-musicians were only allowed limited roles in the recording studio. This was due in part to the excessive time spent filming the TV series, which in turn limited the amount of time available to the group to rehearse and coalesce as a band. Nonetheless, Nesmith did compose and produce some songs from the beginning, and Peter Tork contributed limited guitar work on the Nesmith-produced sessions. They soon fought for and earned the right to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name. Although the sitcom was canceled in 1968, the band continued to record music through 1971. \n\nThe Monkees had a number of international hits, including &quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot;, &quot;I'm a Believer&quot;, &quot;Pleasant Valley Sunday&quot;, and &quot;Daydream Believer&quot;. At their peak in 1967, the band outsold both the Beatles and Rolling Stones. As of 2012, their albums and singles have sold over 65 million copies worldwide. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_of_the_Monkees&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_of_the_Monkees&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eaLDOAAEE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eaLDOAAEE&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video : MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 6000kbps\n   Audio1: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Audio2: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:27\n\n\n*To change the audio in &quot;Media Player Classic&quot;, just go to &quot;Navigate&quot; then &quot;Audio Language&quot; and choose between the 2 sources*\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
