Along \n\nthe way, Hopkins watched the genre change remarkably, but he never \n\nappreciably altered his mournful Lone Star sound, which translated onto \n\nboth acoustic and electric guitar. Hopkins' nimble dexterity made \n\nintricate boogie riffs seem easy, and his fascinating penchant for \n\nimprovising lyrics to fit whatever situation might arise made him a \n\nbeloved blues troubadour.\n\nHopkins' brothers John Henry and Joel were also talented bluesmen, but it \n\nwas Sam who became a star. In 1920, he met the legendary Blind Lemon \n\nJefferson at a social function, and even got a chance to play with him. \n\nLater, Hopkins served as Jefferson's guide. In his teens, Hopkins began \n\nworking with another pre-war great, singer Texas Alexander, who was his \n\ncousin. A mid-'30s stretch in Houston's County Prison Farm for the young \n\nguitarist interrupted their partnership for a time, but when he was \n\nfreed, Hopkins hooked back up with the older bluesman.\n\nThe pair was dishing out their lowdown brand of blues in Houston's Third \n\nWard in 1946 when talent scout Lola Anne Cullum came across them. She had \n\nalready engineered a pact with Los Angeles-based Aladdin Records for \n\nanother of her charges, pianist Amos Milburn, and Cullum saw the same \n\nsort of opportunity within Hopkins' dusty country blues. Alexander wasn't \n\npart of the deal; instead, Cullum paired Hopkins with pianist Wilson \n\n&quot;Thunder&quot; Smith, sensibly re-christened the guitarist &quot;Lightnin',&quot; and \n\npresto! Hopkins was very soon an Aladdin recording artist.\n\n&quot;Katie May,&quot; cut on November 9, 1946, in L.A. with Smith lending a hand \n\non the 88s, was Lightnin' Hopkins' first regional seller of note. He \n\nrecorded prolifically for Aladdin in both L.A. and Houston into 1948, \n\nscoring a national R&amp;B hit for the firm with his &quot;Shotgun Blues.&quot; &quot;Short \n\nHaired Woman,&quot; &quot;Abilene,&quot; and &quot;Big Mama Jump,&quot; among many Aladdin gems, \n\nwere evocative Texas blues rooted in an earlier era.\n\nA load of other labels recorded the wily Hopkins after that, both in a \n\nsolo context and with a small rhythm section: Modern/RPM (his \n\nuncompromising &quot;Tim Moore's Farm&quot; was an R&amp;B hit in 1949); Gold Star \n\n(where he hit with &quot;T-Model Blues&quot; that same year); Sittin' in With \n\n(&quot;Give Me Central 209&quot; and &quot;Coffee Blues&quot; were national chart entries in \n\n1952) and its Jax subsidiary; the major labels Mercury and Decca; and, in \n\n1954, a remarkable batch of sides for Herald where Hopkins played \n\nblistering electric guitar on a series of blasting rockers (&quot;Lightnin's \n\nBoogie,&quot; &quot;Lightnin's Special,&quot; and the amazing &quot;Hopkins' Sky Hop&quot;) in \n\nfront of drummer Ben Turner and bassist Donald Cooks (who must have had \n\nbleeding fingers, so torrid were some of the tempos).\n\nBut Hopkins' style was apparently too rustic and old-fashioned for the \n\nnew generation of rock &amp; roll enthusiasts (they should have checked out \n\n&quot;Hopkins' Sky Hop&quot;). He was back on the Houston scene by 1959, largely \n\nforgotten. Fortunately, folklorist Mack McCormick rediscovered the \n\nguitarist, who was dusted off and presented as a folk-blues artist; a \n\nrole that Hopkins was born to play. Pioneering musicologist Sam Charters \n\nproduced Hopkins in a solo context for Folkways Records that same year, \n\ncutting an entire LP in Hopkins' tiny apartment (on a borrowed guitar). \n\nThe results helped introduced his music to an entirely new audience.\n\nLightnin' Hopkins went from gigging at back-alley gin joints to starring \n\nat collegiate coffeehouses, appearing on TV programs, and touring Europe \n\nto boot. His once-flagging recording career went right through the roof, \n\nwith albums for World Pacific; Vee-Jay; Bluesville; Bobby Robinson's Fire \n\nlabel (where he cut his classic &quot;Mojo Hand&quot; in 1960); Candid; Arhoolie; \n\nPrestige; Verve; and, in 1965, the first of several LPs for Stan Lewis' \n\nShreveport-based Jewel logo.\n\nHopkins generally demanded full payment before he'd deign to sit down and \n\nrecord, and seldom indulged a producer's desire for more than one take of \n\nany song. His singular sense of country time befuddled more than a few \n\nunseasoned musicians; from the 1960s on, his solo work is usually \n\npreferable to band-backed material.\n\nFilmmaker Les Blank captured the Texas troubadour's informal lifestyle \n\nmost vividly in his acclaimed 1967 documentary, The Blues Accordin' to \n\nLightnin' Hopkins. As one of the last great country bluesmen, Hopkins was \n\na fascinating figure who bridged the gap between rural and urban styles. \n\n~ Bill Dahl, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c7f346b78a2c6cec0fc238c806f4e4e8fb010b6","amp;dn":"Lightnin%5C%27+Hopkins+-+The+Very+Best+of+Lightnin%5C%27+Hopkins+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c7f346b78a2c6cec0fc238c806f4e4e8fb010b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,127,52,107,120,162,198,206,192,252,35,140,128,111,78,78,143,176,16,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
