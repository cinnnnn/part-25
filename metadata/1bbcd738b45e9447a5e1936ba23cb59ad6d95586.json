If something breaks, you'll always be able to recover your data.\n- Those who use backup passwords in iTunes must disable them for now. After doing so, iTunes makes a brand new backup. Please wait for that backup to complete before proceeding! Feel free to re-enable your backup password after jailbreaking.\n- Please disable the lock passcode of your iOS device before using evasi0n. It can cause issues.\n- Launch evasi0n, plug in your device, and click &quot;Jailbreak&quot;. Just sit back and observe its progress. Watch for any steps you may be asked to perform.\n- Avoid all iOS and iTunes related tasks until evasi0n is complete. Why not just enjoy a brief break from the computer to stretch your legs?\n- If the process gets stuck somewhere, it's safe to restart the program, reboot the device (if necessary by holding down Power and Home until it shuts down), and rerun the process.\n\n\nFAQ:\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the jailbreak process or jailbreaking in general\nplease go to the Jailbreak QA dedicated website: http://www.jailbreakqa.com\nor see their help page for evasi0n: http://www.jailbreakqa.com/pages/evasi0n-help\nor try /r/jailbreak on Reddit:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bbcd738b45e9447a5e1936ba23cb59ad6d95586","amp;dn":"Iphone+Jailbreak+-+evasi0n+-+iOS+6+x+UNTETHERED+Jailbreak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bbcd738b45e9447a5e1936ba23cb59ad6d95586","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,188,215,56,180,94,148,71,165,225,147,107,162,60,181,154,214,217,85,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
