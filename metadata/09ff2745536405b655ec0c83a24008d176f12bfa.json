Dying in a car accident only hours later wasn't part of that plan. Yet there she was, standing over her own lifeless body and panicking about ruining the truck her parents had bought as a graduation present. Talk about a bad way to repay them.\n\nIf coming to terms with the hereafter wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough to deal with, Isla suddenly finds herself stuck with Hayden, a gorgeous Brit with a bad attitude and a penchant for throwing her off cliffs to keep her in line. Worst of all, Hayden is her Guide, and until she completes six impossible and totally random tasks to reach her mysterious Destination, she's stuck with him. \n\nIsla's major problem, though, is that she doesn't know what reaching her Destination actually entails, and soon the mystery surrounding her new afterlife seems more ominous than any purgatory she could possibly imagine. Now Isla must decide if she'll trust her dark and brooding Guide despite his &quot;bad boy&quot; act, or if she'll risk failing her tasks and facing the unknown alone.\n\nGenre: Romance\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09ff2745536405b655ec0c83a24008d176f12bfa","amp;dn":"Under+Zenith+by+Shannen+Crane+Camp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09ff2745536405b655ec0c83a24008d176f12bfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,255,39,69,83,100,5,182,85,236,12,131,162,64,8,209,118,241,43,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
