A now classic story, as part of Brubaker's run, it is included for the sake of completeness and as a different look at the landmark issue. The splash page with the reveal of the new Cap is one of my favorites. Thanks to Minutemen-Zone for this great scan - please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f091064584d814d4b892a5d28f2278387bb5b9e6","amp;dn":"Captain+America+v5+034+-+Director%27s+Cut+%282008%29+%28Minutemen-Zone%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f091064584d814d4b892a5d28f2278387bb5b9e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,145,6,69,132,216,20,212,184,146,165,210,143,34,120,56,123,181,185,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
