Niall Shanksâ€™s book is a shrewd broadside in what will, I fear, be a lengthy campaign. It will not change the minds of the wedgies themselves. Nothing will do that, especially in cases where, as Shanks astutely realizes, the perceived moral, social, and political implications of a theory are judged more important than the truth of that theory. But this book will sway readers who are genuinely undecided and honestly curious. And, perhaps more importantly, it should stiffen the resolve of demoralized biology teachers, struggling to do their duty by the children in their care but threatened and intimidated by aggressive parents and school boards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07bf8a7e111b54b3e8ef686c82cfef4ec51dbeac","amp;dn":"God%2C+the+Devil%2C+and+Darwin%3A+A+Critique+of+Intelligent+Design+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07bf8a7e111b54b3e8ef686c82cfef4ec51dbeac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,191,138,126,17,27,84,179,232,239,104,108,130,207,239,78,197,29,190,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
