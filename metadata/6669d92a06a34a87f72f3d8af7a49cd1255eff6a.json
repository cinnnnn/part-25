Together these novels tell a vibrant tale of conspiracy, espionage, murder, comedy and abuse of state power through a fascinating and flawed set of characters; a tale that resonates with our own time and beyond Scandinavia.\n\nDeath of a pilgrim is a highly entertaining and informed combination of satire, black humour, thriller, psychological drama and police procedure. It is a universal story, mirroring other international conflicts as well as questioning modern democracy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6669d92a06a34a87f72f3d8af7a49cd1255eff6a","amp;dn":"En+pilgrims+dod+%28%2B+English+Subs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6669d92a06a34a87f72f3d8af7a49cd1255eff6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,105,217,42,6,163,74,135,247,47,61,138,247,164,156,209,37,94,255,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
