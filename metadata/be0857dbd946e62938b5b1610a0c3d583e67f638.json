Second Law: a robot must obey orders \ngiven it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with \nthe First Law. Third Law: A robot must protect its own existence as \nlong as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. \nGiven these three laws, etched into every robot's positronic brain, \nrobots must live alongside humans. They can astonish - and perhaps surpass \n- their creators. Here, Isaac Asimov, one of the Grand Masters of science \nfiction, tells us the stories of the robots of which he dreamed, from \nthe first days of their creation to the days of their ultimate sophistication.\n\n&quot;One of the great classics of science fiction.&quot; (Amazon.com)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be0857dbd946e62938b5b1610a0c3d583e67f638","amp;dn":"Isaac+Asimov+-+I%2C+Robot+%28Sci-Fi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be0857dbd946e62938b5b1610a0c3d583e67f638","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,8,87,219,217,70,230,41,56,181,177,97,10,12,61,88,62,103,246,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
