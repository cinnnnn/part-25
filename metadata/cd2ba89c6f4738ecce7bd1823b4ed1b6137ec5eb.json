It was aired on Feb 25, 2013 on CBC HD in Canada. Like all of my releases to date, the source is an analog rip, so the quality is, at best, something like A8 V8. \n\n--- File Information --- \nFile Name:            Murdoch.Mysteries.S06E07.The.Ghost.of.Queens.Park.WS.XviD-err0001.avi\nFile Size:            366,942,208 bytes\n\n--- Video Information --- \nCodec:                XVID\nDuration:             44:02.786\nFrame Width:          624\nFrame Height:         352\nFramerate:            23.976 fps\nBitrate:              971 kbps\n\n--- Audio Information --- \nCodec:                0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate:          48000 Hz\nBitrate:              127 kbps\nBitrate Type:         VBR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd2ba89c6f4738ecce7bd1823b4ed1b6137ec5eb","amp;dn":"Murdoch+Mysteries+S06E07+The+Ghost+of+Queens+Park+WS.XviD-err000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd2ba89c6f4738ecce7bd1823b4ed1b6137ec5eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,43,168,156,111,71,56,236,206,123,209,130,59,78,209,182,19,126,197,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
