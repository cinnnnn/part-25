It was critically acclaimed (recipient of the Software Development Magazine Productivity Award) and widely embraced by customers. The second edition maintains the goals of the first edition: to define and explain software architecture, and to demonstrate, through real-world case studies, its importance for software system design. The added goals of the second edition are to bring the content up-to-date with significant developments in the understanding and practice of software architecture in the past five years. These developments include advances in architecture analysis, design, reconstruction, and documentationÃ¢â‚¬â€advances in which the authors, through their work at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), have played a direct and prominent role.\n\n\n\nPW/Password/ContraseÃƒÂ±a : comoustedyasabe2007","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f059c59546795ffc99ca45d268922914aa40966","amp;dn":"Addison+Wesley+-+Software+Architecture+in+Practice+2da","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f059c59546795ffc99ca45d268922914aa40966","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,5,156,89,84,103,149,255,201,156,164,93,38,137,34,145,74,164,9,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
