Previous accounts of the Rendlesham Forest incident have been flawed: people with axes to grind and little access to primary sources and discreditable single eyewitness accounts. Georgina Bruni has had access to police, Ministry of Defence and US military sources and her casebook reveals fresh information on the incident and the possible alien encounter that ensued. It includes interviews with those involved as well as other never-before-reported incidents in the area. The casebook also reveals details of the aftermath and the harsh treatment meted out to those who wavered from the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; line of officialdom. 'While twenty years have passed, she brings new light to this story that just won't go away...' Major General Gordon E. Williams, USAF (Retired)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6389b475ae9b9a08f1cbb6b459d88a9dc809c319","amp;dn":"The+Rendlesham+Forest+UFO+Incident+%28ePub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6389b475ae9b9a08f1cbb6b459d88a9dc809c319","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,137,180,117,174,155,154,8,241,203,182,180,89,216,138,157,200,9,195,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
