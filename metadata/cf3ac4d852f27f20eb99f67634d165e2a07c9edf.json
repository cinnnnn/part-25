Mackâ€˜s investigation of the various groups and strands of the early Christian community out of which were generated the texts of Christianityâ€˜s first anthology of religious literature and makes sense of a topic that has been confusing.\r\n\r\nCertainly Mack's book should take a place in the front ranks of the many fine introductions available to students of the New Testament in both academic and nonacademic settings. A comprehensive synthesis of New Testament scholarship that is nevertheless popularly accessible, it will make a particularly useful introductory text in an area where such texts are in great demand. But it is more than an excellent introduction. As the subtitle suggests, the book is also a critical account of the making of the Christian myth--an invitation to critical reflection on the social construction of a foundational epic that has shaped (and been shaped by) the history and behavior of the West since Constantine. That makes it an introduction to mythmaking that is more than a colonial criticism or classification of other people's myths; it is an invitation to cultural self-criticism, an invaluable contribution to liberal education that is a potentially important corrective to triumphalist practices as tempting in our multicultural age as they were in the multicultural matrix out of which Christian scripture emerged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf3ac4d852f27f20eb99f67634d165e2a07c9edf","amp;dn":"Who+Wrote+the+New+Testament+-+Burton+L.+Mack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf3ac4d852f27f20eb99f67634d165e2a07c9edf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,58,196,216,82,242,127,32,235,153,246,118,52,209,101,226,160,124,158,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
