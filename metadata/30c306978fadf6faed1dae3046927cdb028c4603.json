Endless Sea 07:34 \n\nNight Meets The Day (1976) is a concept album with a nautical theme and is a far more adventurous album than their debut. The band is tighter yet more spacious in their playing, which allows them to express their musical vision with more feeling. The atmosphere of the album is more melancholy, although not dark or depressing. On songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shipwrecked StrandedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Harlis sound even more like a band working together as a unit, playing live together in the studio and capturing the moment on tape. While the individual players are exceptional, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interesting to hear their understated and relaxed interaction.  The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instrumental, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Endless SeaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, sounds like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s floating about the room instead of bouncing off the walls.  Sure, there are rockers here (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rules Of The IslandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Last Sea BattleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“King Of The PiratesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), the album is more about atmosphere, feeling and vibes.
