Rochester\r\n\r\nIt was fitting that the senior officer aboard the first plane to land at Clark Air Base in the Philippines following the release of the American prisoners of war from Hanoi in 1973 was a naval officer. When a thin, wan Captain Jeremiah Denton descended the ramp to a bank of microphones and uttered the poignant words, â€œWe are honored to have had the opportunity to serve our country under difficult circumstances,â€ he spoke for the entire body of comrades who over the past decade had endured the longest wartime captivity of any group of U.S. prisoners in the nationâ€™s history. But no servicemen suffered through a longer, rougher captivity, or played a more prominent role in the leadership and life of the American-occupied prison camps in Southeast Asia, than the veteran Navy and Marine POWs among the Operation Homecoming returnees. They comprised a high percentage of the early captures, dominated the ranks of the early seniors, and contributed vitally by deed and by example to the high standard of conduct and resistance that so distinguished the POWs of the Vietnam War. \r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ccb5590b947d25a74d81f468b86f98867ced355","amp;dn":"The+Battle+Behind+Bars+-+Stuart+I.+Rochester+%5BEN+PDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ccb5590b947d25a74d81f468b86f98867ced355","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,203,85,144,185,71,210,90,116,216,31,70,139,134,249,136,103,206,211,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
