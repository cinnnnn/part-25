As a result, she has been reassigned to the Counter terrorism center. Whilst in Iraq, she was warned that an American prisoner had been turned by Al-Qaeda. When Nicholas Brody, a U.S. Marine Sergeant, is rescued after being held hostage since 2003, she suspects that he is the turned American prisoner. Brody is received home as a war hero, so Carrie goes to any lengths possible, ignoring protocol, to catch him out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9467531971f9ba251981b75bd323efa785afd950","amp;dn":"Homeland+S01+Complete+%28Xvid%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9467531971f9ba251981b75bd323efa785afd950","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,103,83,25,113,249,186,37,25,129,183,91,211,35,239,167,133,175,217,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
