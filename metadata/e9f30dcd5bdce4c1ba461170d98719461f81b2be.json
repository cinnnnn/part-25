Hundreds of miles from ZaraCorpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s headquarters on planet, 178 light-years from the corporationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s headquarters on Earth, Jack is content as an independent contractor, prospecting and surveying at his own pace. As for his past, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not up for discussion.\n\nThen, in the wake of an accidental cliff collapse, Jack discovers a seam of unimaginably valuable jewels, to which he manages to lay legal claim just as ZaraCorp is cancelling their contract with him for his part in causing the collapse. Briefly in the catbird seat, legally speaking, Jack pressures ZaraCorp into recognizing his claim, and cuts them in as partners to help extract the wealth.\n\nBut thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another wrinkle to ZaraCorpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship with the planet Zarathustra. Their entire legal right to exploit the verdant Earth-like planet, the basis of the wealth they derive from extracting its resources, is based on being able to certify to the authorities on Earth that Zarathustra is home to no sentient species.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9f30dcd5bdce4c1ba461170d98719461f81b2be","amp;dn":"John+Scalzi-Fuzzy+Nation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9f30dcd5bdce4c1ba461170d98719461f81b2be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,243,13,205,91,220,228,193,186,70,17,112,217,135,25,70,31,129,178,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
