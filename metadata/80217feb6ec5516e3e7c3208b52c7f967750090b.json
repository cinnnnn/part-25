RC4 encryption is mandatory.\n\n\nenjoy ;-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80217feb6ec5516e3e7c3208b52c7f967750090b","amp;dn":"Jean+Michel+Jarre+discography+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80217feb6ec5516e3e7c3208b52c7f967750090b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,33,127,235,110,197,81,110,62,124,50,8,181,44,127,150,119,80,9,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
