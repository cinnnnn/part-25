In a nod to the Shadow's long-running radio serial, Goldsmith punctuates his melodies with electronic effects and other elements of sonic sleight-of-hand, but the crashing percussion and volcanic brass require little aid in communicating the narrative's action. Unfortunately, Arista's official soundtrack release butchers Goldsmith's score to a mere 30 minutes to make room for two (!) renditions of Taylor Dayne's awful &quot;Original Sin&quot; alongside dialogue from the film and an Orson Welles-headlined radio episode. With any luck, a specialty label like Varese Sarabande or Intrada will ultimately reissue the score in full, exacting vengeance upon the evil that lurks in the hearts of Arista execs.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - The Shadow Knows... 1994 - Alec Baldwin  [0:07]\n02 - Original Sin (Theme from the Shadow) - Taylor Dayne  [6:24]\n03 - The Poppy Fields (Main Title) - Jerry Goldsmith  [3:20]\n04 - Some Kind of Mystery - Sinoa  [3:34]\n05 - The Sanctum - Jerry Goldsmith  [3:36]\n06 - Who Are You? - Jerry Goldmsith  [4:05]\n07 - Chest Pains - Jerry Goldsmith  [3:28]\n08 - The Knife - Jerry Goldsmith  [3:07]\n09 - The Hotel - Jerry Goldsmith  [5:56]\n10 - The Tank - Jerry Goldsmith  [4:07]\n11 - Frontal Lobotomy - Jerry Goldsmith  [2:31]\n12 - Original Sin (Theme from the Shadow) [Film Mix] - Taylor Dayne  [5:23]\n13 - The Shadow Radio Show 1937: Who Knows What Evil Lurks in the Hearts of Men? - Orson Welles  [0:31]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb8921d82b815a52975206685c2efb30d4fd9a2c","amp;dn":"The+Shadow+-+Soundtrack+%281994%29+128kbps+%5BRussTheStalker%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb8921d82b815a52975206685c2efb30d4fd9a2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,137,33,216,43,129,90,82,151,82,6,104,92,46,251,48,212,253,154,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
