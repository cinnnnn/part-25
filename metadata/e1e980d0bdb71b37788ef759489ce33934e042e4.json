It can be used to build applications that combine transactional, analytical, graph, probabilistic, and mathematical programming. LogiQL makes it possible to build hybrid applications that previously required multiple programming languages and databases. In this first book to cover LogiQL, the authors explain how to design, implement, and query deductive databases using this new programming language.\r\n\r\nLogiQLâ€™s declarative approach enables complex data structures and business rules to be simply specified and then automatically executed. It is especially suited to business applications requiring complex rules to be implemented efficiently, for example predictive analytics and supply chain optimization.\r\n\r\nSuitable for both novices and experienced developers, the book is written in easy-to-understand language. It includes many examples and exercises throughout to illustrate the main concepts and consolidate understanding","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1e980d0bdb71b37788ef759489ce33934e042e4","amp;dn":"LogiQL%3A+A+Query+Language+for+Smart+Databases+%5B2014%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1e980d0bdb71b37788ef759489ce33934e042e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,233,128,208,189,183,27,55,120,142,247,89,72,156,227,57,52,224,66,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
