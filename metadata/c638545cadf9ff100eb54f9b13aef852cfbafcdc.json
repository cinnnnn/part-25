His excellent work on director\nChristopher Nolan's 2008 international blockbuster The Dark\nKnight, was disqualified for Oscar consideration due to too many\ncooks (composers) in the kitchen, a handicap that doesn't apply\nto Nolan's 2010 follow-up, Inception. Zimmer's signature move, a\nfour- to eight-chord round that builds from a subtle breeze to an\nF5 tornado, serves as the foundation for Inception's dizzying\nscore, and the addition of Smiths/Cribs guitarist Johnny Marr\nwho appears on eight of the twelve cuts, dutifully expands the\nlayers of Zimmer's melodies, much like the dream building that\noccurs onscreen. There are moments that bring to mind Vangelis'\nmoody, jazz-kissed work on Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, but\nInception's backbone is pure Zimmer. It's beautiful and heroic\nunhinged and unspeakably melancholy, and the finest and most\nfully realized soundtrack this prolific composer has crafted to\ndate","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c638545cadf9ff100eb54f9b13aef852cfbafcdc","amp;dn":"Hans_Zimmer-Inception_Music_From_The_Motion_Picture-OST-CD-FLAC-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c638545cadf9ff100eb54f9b13aef852cfbafcdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,56,84,92,173,249,255,16,14,181,79,155,19,174,248,82,207,186,252,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
