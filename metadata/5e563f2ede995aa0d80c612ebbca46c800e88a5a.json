Roebuck has seen it all and isn?t afraid to comment: he?s interviewed Sir (or is that Saint?) Garfield Sobers? mum, was on the scene (and on the front page) when Gilchrist walked?, poked gentle fun at Inzamam?s fielding, and touched many with his account of young Sri Lankan boys playing cricket on a beach in Galle.\n\nPeter Roebuck pulls no punches - whether friend or foe, all his subjects are linked by the great and noble game of cricket and he is not afraid to tell it how he sees it.\n\nAbout the Author\nPeter Roebuck graduated in Law from Cambridge University, and played for Somerset as an opening batsman for some fifteen years, the last few as captain. In the late seventies he started spending the &quot;off season&quot; in Australia, first of all as a teacher at Cranbrook and then as a fulltime journalist and commentator.\n\nBest known to Australian cricket fans as the incisive and sometimes controversial, cricketing voice of the Sydney Morning Herald and ABC radio, Peter Roebuck?s career has spanned 25 of the most exhilarating years of world cricket.\n\nTable of Contents\nPreface \nChapter 1 Arrivals \nChapter 2 Champions and their deeds \nChapter 3 Soaring subcontinentals \nChapter 4 Breaking barriers \nChapter 5 To be an Englishman \nChapter 6 Shafts of lightning \nChapter 7 From the Caribbean \nChapter 8 From various angles \nChapter 9 From the Dark Continent \nChapter 10 Salt of the earth \nChapter 11 Australians at work \nChapter 12 Reputations \nChapter 13 Leaving the stage \nChapter 14 Retirements \nChapter 15 Dealing with life \nChapter 16 Departures \nAfterward","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e563f2ede995aa0d80c612ebbca46c800e88a5a","amp;dn":"It+Takes+All+Sorts%3A+Celebrating+cricket%27s+colourful+characters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e563f2ede995aa0d80c612ebbca46c800e88a5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,86,63,46,222,153,90,160,216,12,97,46,187,202,70,200,0,232,138,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
