It peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Pop Albums charts in 1974.\n\nAllmusic stated: &quot;Recorded in the same year as the Brothers and Sisters album, this solo debut release is a beautiful amalgam of R&amp;B, folk, and gospel sounds, with the best singing on any of Gregg Allman's solo releases.&quot; In Rolling Stone, reviewer Tony Glover said &quot;Laid Back isn't quite what you'd expect from Gregg's work with the Brothers Band. Instead, it's a moody LP, often tinged with grandeur, and maybe just a little too rich and one-colored in spots. But on the whole, a moving look at another side of a finely charismatic singer/writer.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db2727180f9a150761a7db73300a3c9bf4833be0","amp;dn":"Gregg+Allman+-+%5C%27Laid+Back%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db2727180f9a150761a7db73300a3c9bf4833be0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,39,39,24,15,154,21,7,97,167,219,115,48,10,60,155,244,131,59,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
