The rest of the album is nearly as dark, with the overall tone ranging from hopeful melancholy to the absolutely bleak despair of &quot;She Moves AmongMen (The Barmaid's Song)&quot;. One gets the idea that the album's title has less to do with cats, despite the cartoony cover drawing, and more to do with the concepts of &quot;abyss&quot; and &quot;sin&quot;. ABYSSINIANS is as bleak as Joy Division's CLOSER or the darkest hours of hardcore country music, and like those albums, there's a cathartic spirit to this album that makes itultimately a satisfying listening experience. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp \n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/30/june-tabor/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/30/june-tabor/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dbdea6a77988a099f78779f3272c90852893769","amp;dn":"June+Tabor...Abyssinians%281983%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dbdea6a77988a099f78779f3272c90852893769","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,189,234,106,119,152,138,9,159,120,119,159,50,114,201,8,82,137,55,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
