The Characters tab lets you insert these entities with a click of your mouse.\n    * Cross-browser compatibility is important, so the HTML Editor gives you the option to add up to 10 different browsers and then open them from inside the program.\n    * Split-Screen Preview lets you view your Webpage in a browser right from inside the Code Editor.\n    * Looking for something? Use the Search bar, located conveniently in the Toolbar.\n    * We improved the Extended Find and Replace function. Would you believe it's about 85% faster than before?\n    * Check out the new CSS Menu Builder. It creates awesome CSS navigation menus for your Webpages. These menus look great, work in any browser, and are easily customizable.\n    * The HTML Editor comes with 10 new, professionally designed themes. Preview them before you apply them to your pages in the snazzy new Theme Chooser.\n    * We completely overhauled the help manual. The new document is packed with tutorials, FAQs, a comprehensive glossary, and easy-to-understand explanations of each and every program feature.\n    * Typing the same code over and over again wastes time and, frankly, can be a bit boring. But with the Code Snippets tool, you can save your commonly used code and insert it on your page with a click of your mouse. The program also comes with several built-in code snippets to help get you started.\n    * Spelling mistakes and typos are a thing of the past with our spell-check feature. The HTML Editor checks for errors as you type ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ all you have to do is right-click the selection for the correct spelling.\n    * Add custom spell-check dictionaries for error-free code in any language.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:195f478528da90b36159077e473036c4df94093d","amp;dn":"HTML+Editor+2009.305+CoffeCup+-+FOSI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"195f478528da90b36159077e473036c4df94093d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,95,71,133,40,218,144,179,97,89,7,126,71,48,54,196,223,148,9,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
