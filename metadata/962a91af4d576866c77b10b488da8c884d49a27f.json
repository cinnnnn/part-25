Together they raised four boys. The boys grew and turned into men, as boys tend to do. The home was small but the meals were adequate. When Melvin was 25, Herman died of heart failure. The boys got together with their momma and held a vigil for the old man. They swore to take care of Momma and stay close as they had been when they were children. On their way home that very evening, the Willsniffs were run off the road by a careless motorist. Carson tried to steer the car, but it was too late. All four were seriously injured in the crash, but not critically. After a week, the reality began to sink in. They swore to still take care of Momma and pay tribute to Daddy. Having no real skills, they decided to form a bandÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.something they had dreamed about since childhood. David barely knew how to play an instrument and Carson was not far behind. Melvin had played drums in high school, but he had a new problem. Sometimes his legs donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work! Lance had played a bit of drums in school as well, but decided to learn guitar after the accident. To put it all together was going to take a lot of work. Long story short, it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work at all. The Willsniffs decided to put on a mostly improv concert, but nobody came. That was because it was an ode to Daddy and no one was invited. They called the concert Not Dead and recorded it. The results were? \n\n\n\n\nMelvin Willsniff is many things, but don't call him a cripple. He is the drummer/percussionist for The Willsniffs. Though he is in a wheelchair he can still make use of of his legs. He also uses preprogrammed drums to assist. Before the car accident, he was a sanitation engineer and part time prep cook. \n\n\nYou can call Lance many things, but normal is not one of them. He truly does not care what people think. He will do what he pleases and harms no one. He likes to talk a lot but barely sings on stage. Lance has a limp from the car accident, but his quick fingers were spared. He quickly learned the guitar from his hospital bed and just recently started playing electric. Lance is an electrical engineer but hasn't found it rewarding \n\nNever mind David's bald head, this guy is the lead singer most of the time and head songwriter. He is the Willsniff that has had a number of issues since the car accident. Sometimes he will yammer away and make up things as he goes. He tried to learn bass specifically for the album. He enjoys learning new skills and is known as an autodidact. \n\nCarson Willsniff is a funny guy, He only smokes for pictures and is an overall health nut. His eyepatch is not just for show. As the driver of the car on the night of the accident he suffered the least damage but lost an eye. That's okay because Carson is the most pleasant of The Willsniffs. He is shy when it comes to singing and let's his naked voice be heard on a few of the songs. He learned keyboards for the sake of the album. He is the group motivator.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:962a91af4d576866c77b10b488da8c884d49a27f","amp;dn":"Pass+The+Laugh+-+The+WIllsniffs+%28Video+HQ%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"962a91af4d576866c77b10b488da8c884d49a27f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,42,145,175,77,87,104,102,199,123,16,180,136,218,140,136,77,73,162,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
