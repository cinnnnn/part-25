But it brought the band to the attention of Larry Page, and his record company Page One Records, which signed the band.  Two further singles were released that year (in October and December) - mono mixes of four tracks which were to appear on the album.  The band's sole LP was released in February 1969.\n\nBut the band hardly ever played live, and with almost no promotion for the record or the band, the album was a commercial failure, and the band broke up soon after.\n\nThe first 7&quot; has not been re-issued since, and remains an obscure rarity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87591e72a6ca0947397ca79dffebf250046eae3f","amp;dn":"Apple+-+An+Apple+A+Day+%281969%29+%28mp3%29%28320+kbps%29%28psych%2Crock%2Cblues%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87591e72a6ca0947397ca79dffebf250046eae3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,89,30,114,166,202,9,71,57,124,167,157,255,235,242,80,4,110,174,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
