The album also contained a song called &quot;We're Illegal&quot; which was later turned into &quot;Live to Rock&quot;.\n\nThe album was renamed and released in the U.S. in 1983. It reached number 136 on the Billboard 200.[3] The title track was named the 62nd greatest hard rock song by VH1.[4] It is featured on the radio station &quot;V-ROCK&quot; in the 2006 video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories. The album was considered a flop by the Elektra label, which had the intention to drop the band. However, Dokken management convinced the label that they could make a more successful album, which materialized in Tooth and Nail in September 1984.\n\nIn a discussion with George Lynch on January 26, 2011, he mentioned the existence of 500 copies of the Carrere Records Breakin' the Chains version printed with the Don Dokken moniker, instead of Dokken. This version also featured different album cover art. Lynch also mentioned that the bassist that actually played on the album was Peter Baltes\n\nFLAC\n\nDokken\n\nBreaking The Chains\n\n1983\n\nCD\n\n1.\t&quot;Breaking the Chains&quot; Ã‚Â \tÃ‚Â \t3:43\n2.\t&quot;In the Middle&quot; Ã‚Â \tÃ‚Â \t3:43\n3.\t&quot;Felony&quot; Ã‚Â \tÃ‚Â \t3:08\n4.\t&quot;I Can't See You&quot; Ã‚Â \tDokken, Juan Croucier\t3:12\n5.\t&quot;Live to Rock (Rock to Live)&quot; Ã‚Â \tDokken, Lynch, Croucier\t3:39\n6.\t&quot;Nightrider&quot; Ã‚Â \tDokken, Lynch, Mick Brown\t3:13\n7.\t&quot;Seven Thunders&quot; Ã‚Â \tDokken, Lynch, Brown\t3:55\n8.\t&quot;Young Girls&quot; Ã‚Â \tÃ‚Â \t3:14\n9.\t&quot;Stick to Your Guns&quot; Ã‚Â \tÃ‚Â \t3:25\n10.\t&quot;Paris is Burning (Live)&quot; Ã‚Â ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fa857e9b3bbc619ea1a178038033bb3da07d3c3","amp;dn":"Dokken+-+Breaking+The+Chains+%281983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fa857e9b3bbc619ea1a178038033bb3da07d3c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,168,87,233,179,187,198,25,234,26,23,128,56,3,59,179,218,7,211,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
