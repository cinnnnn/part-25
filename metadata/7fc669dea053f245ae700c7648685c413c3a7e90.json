I live in the Appalachian Mountains with my family and my dog and cat.\n\nMy Lord and Spymaster (Book 2)\n\nAfter her father is wrongly accused of selling secrets to Napoleon, lovely Jess Whitby infiltrates the London underworld for the real traitorÃ¢â‚¬â€only to end up naked in the bed of a rude merchant captain. Not only is she falling in love with him, but he may be the scoundrel she's looking for.\n\nThe Forbidden Rose (Book 3)\n\nA career is blooming... A glittering French aristocrat is on the run, disguised as a British governess. England's top spy has a score to settle with her family. But as they're drawn inexorably into the intrigue and madness of Revolutionary Paris, they gamble on a love to which neither of them will admit.\n\nThe Black Hawk (Book 4)\n\nAttacked on a rainy London street, veteran spy Justine DeCabrillan knows only one man can help her: Hawker, who also happens to be the enemy. With London crawling with hidden assassins and someone out to frame Hawker for the assault, the two spies must work together to find who's out to destroy them...\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fc669dea053f245ae700c7648685c413c3a7e90","amp;dn":"Spymaster%27s+Lady+Series+-+Joanna+Bourne%2CEpub%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fc669dea053f245ae700c7648685c413c3a7e90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,198,105,222,160,83,242,69,174,112,12,118,72,104,92,65,60,58,126,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
