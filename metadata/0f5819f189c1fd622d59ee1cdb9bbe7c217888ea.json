The band existed from 1976 to 1996, with a brief return in 2006, although they had a period of inactivity between 1989 and 1994. Their music has been categorized as space rock, and lyrics are dominated by science fiction themes. In November 2011, Cameron Hawkins has been quoted by the OhioProg 2012 organizers as having reformed the band with two new players.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f5819f189c1fd622d59ee1cdb9bbe7c217888ea","amp;dn":"FM+-+RetroActive%3A+FM+Archives+Vol.+1+%5B1995%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f5819f189c1fd622d59ee1cdb9bbe7c217888ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,88,25,241,137,193,253,98,45,89,238,28,219,155,190,124,33,120,136,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
