Hearkening back to a somewhat simpler, more basic British Invasion approach as psychedelia began to explode in the late '60s, the group also reached the Top Five with their flower-power ballad &quot;Love Is All Around&quot; in 1968. While more popular in their native England than the U.S., the band also fashioned memorable, insistently riffing hit singles like &quot;With a Girl Like You,&quot; &quot;Night of the Long Grass,&quot; and the notoriously salacious &quot;I Can't Control Myself&quot; between 1966 and 1968. Paced by Reg Presley's lusting vocals, the group -- which composed most of their own material -- could crunch with the best of them, but were also capable of quite a bit more range and melodic invention than they've been given credit for.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-troggs-p5701/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-troggs-p5701/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Steve Leggett):\n\nThis set collects the half-dozen or so EPs that the Troggs released for Fontana Records during their peak commercial run in the mid- to late '60s, and while the group's biggest hits are here, including their signature caveman stomper &quot;Wild Thing&quot; (written by Chip Taylor and featuring an improbable ocarina solo), the pop gem &quot;With a Girl Like You.&quot; and the breezy ballad &quot;Love Is All Around,&quot; what makes this compilation interesting are the various other tracks that either show the Troggs trying to replicate their biggest successes by cloning them under the guise of a new song or truly stretching into different territory (the opening track, &quot;Oh No,&quot; which features a distinct Byrds-like jangle, is a good example of the latter). Lead singer Reg Presley's vocals range from sneering to sweet, mellow, and flowery, depending on the song, but what emerges here is the fact that the Troggs, although they had a proto-punk image thanks to the 1966 success of &quot;Wild Thing,&quot; were really a power pop band specializing in pretty ballads, and they were quite good at it.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-ep-collection-r260937&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-ep-collection-r260937&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000086OC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000086OC&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
