MacFarlane plays it straight \nthroughout Music Is Better Than Words, hiring American Dad composer Joel \nMcNeely to create approximations of Nelson Riddle, Gordon Jenkins, and Billy \nMay's arrangements for Frank Sinatra's deathless, mid-century records for \nCapitol. These classic concept albums are clearly the blueprint for Music Is \nBetter Than Words which was, after all, recorded at Capitol Records' \nlegendary studio with MacFarlane singing into the very same microphone \nSinatra used all those years ago, and there is a bit of a concept to this 2011 \nLP, too, with the cartoonist selecting songs never recorded by any member \nof the Rat Pack -- along with a couple recent tunes like &quot;She's Wonderful \nToo,&quot; which McNeely originally wrote for The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles \n-- for his tribute to that ring-a-ding-ding swing. MacFarlane and McNeely \ndon't attempt to ape the pizzazz of Frank's Reprise years, nor do they spend \nmuch time with May's snazzy snap, they stick with Riddle and Jenkins, \nkeeping things sentimental and lush even when the words crackle with wit.\n\nProduct Details\nRelease Date: 9/27/2011\nLabel: Republic\nCatalog Number: 001559110\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27c916f23bfb7cef9a86deddc7949b686e8fd1dd","amp;dn":"Seth+MacFarlane+-+Music+Is+Better+Than+Words+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27c916f23bfb7cef9a86deddc7949b686e8fd1dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,201,22,242,59,251,124,239,154,134,222,221,199,148,155,104,110,143,209,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
