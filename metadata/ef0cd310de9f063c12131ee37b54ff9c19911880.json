Her moving &quot;Face of Love&quot; and &quot;Hands&quot; are certain to become holiday standards, capable of being sung in a country, pop, gospel, or R&amp;B vein and deserving of an audience as wide as the nation itself. The record's centerpiece, however, seems to be a six-minute-plus medley that mixes &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; with the recent hit &quot;From a Distance&quot; and her own &quot;Life Uncommon.&quot; Nonetheless, her stunning adaptation of &quot;Gloria&quot; inspired, in part, by Bach's B-Minor Mass, two tracks later is as powerful and lovely a Christmas vocal performance as you will find anywhere. Produced by the legendary Arif Mardin, Joy is destined to become a holiday classic.\n\nAllmusic Review:\nJoy: A Holiday Collection may surprise some Jewel fans, since it isn't a warm, intimate acoustic album. Then again, it may not, since it arrives on the heels of the exquisitely produced, unabashedly pop Spirit, which had lush musical backdrops for her folk-pop tunes. Joy is a full-bodied expansion of Spirit, however -- an unashamed classicist Christmas album, featuring all of the usual carols delivered with strings and choirs. Because Jewel has a big, powerful, attractive voice, Joy works, even if it is a little too predictable for its own good -- the closing &quot;Christmas Version&quot; of &quot;Hands&quot; is the only true signal, musically at least, that this is a Jewel number. Surely, this holiday album isn't a major addition to her catalog, but for hardcore fans, it may be a nice stocking stuffer.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef0cd310de9f063c12131ee37b54ff9c19911880","amp;dn":"Jewel+-+Joy%3A+A+Holiday+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef0cd310de9f063c12131ee37b54ff9c19911880","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,12,211,16,222,159,6,60,18,19,30,227,123,84,255,156,25,145,24,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
