Bringing together contributions from a variety of academic disciplines, this lively text examines contemporary theoretical debates and analyzes media as diverse as television, cinema, literature, print media and the Internet. Centring around themes of 'virtual' bodies, audiences, representations and public health, it examines discourses of sexuality, gender, race, disability, childhood, medico-moral panics, regulation and governmentality.\nAbout the Author\nMARTIN KING is Senior Lecturer and KATHERINE WATSON is Lecturer, both in the Department of Health Care Studies at Manchester Metropolitan University, UK","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12bfcc46c085af9dcee5c6d9db1244ea7ec2b8b0","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2004%5D+Representing+Health","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12bfcc46c085af9dcee5c6d9db1244ea7ec2b8b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,191,204,70,192,133,175,157,206,229,198,217,219,18,68,234,126,194,184,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
