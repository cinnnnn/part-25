It includes \n\ndozens of lessons and exercises that explain basic programming \n\nconcepts in detail.\n\nFor any child that has an avid interest in computers, one of the \n\nmost magical experiences is when they write their first program. \n\nMicrosoft seeks to introduce that amazing experience to students as \n\nwell as adults with an impressive new programming tutoring tool \n\ncalled Small Basic.\n\nSmall Basic is essentially a &quot;small&quot; version of Microsoft's well \n\nknown programming language called Visual Basic. Visual Basic itself \n\nis anything but basic, so by offering Small Basic, Microsoft can \n\nmake inroads with younger students. Small Basic may be a training \n\ntool, but it is a powerful enough programming tool so that some \n\nusers have even created highly functional and intricate games such \n\nas board games or even simulations.\n\nHowever, the real value of this software comes from its use in the \n\nclassroom or in a home-school setting, where each lesson is laid \n\nout by Microsoft in a series of instructional lessons followed by \n\nexercises where the student can put what they've learned into \n\npractical use.\n\n\nENJOY AND SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e279aec6369bf12f1a4676e1f38be127732ad02","amp;dn":"MS+Small+Basic+-+2010kaiser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e279aec6369bf12f1a4676e1f38be127732ad02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,39,154,236,99,105,191,18,241,164,103,110,31,56,190,18,119,50,173,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
