In my estimation, the material is only mildly offensive, and in this case decidedly less so than the resultant would-be-remedial hatchet job is to the work's artistic integrity. Moreover, the passages in question are hardly &quot;porn&quot; - do not primarily aim to arouse - in the first place, despite the use of the term by the authors themselves, but are concerned with the various sexual aspects of the human condition. Thus, the price of sanitizing them is rather steep: It compromises an entire layer of content and context - while demonstrating some of its very points in a sort of self-referential way that is both curious and creepy.\n\nFeel free to discuss the pros and cons below. I reserve the right to censor that hypothetical discussion by withholding my even more hypothetical contributions, though! :P\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f68c225092c3ebf2a022f65a29f29b07fac4ac74","amp;dn":"Alan+Moore%3A+Lost+Girls+V3+%28DE-BOWDLERIZED%29+%282006%7CDgtl%7CK7-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f68c225092c3ebf2a022f65a29f29b07fac4ac74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,140,34,80,146,195,235,242,160,34,246,90,41,242,155,7,250,196,172,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
