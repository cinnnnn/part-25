The 15-track tape was completed shortly after a life-changing period in the skilled beatmaker's life, which included the passing of his grandfather and his relocation to Germany (where he currently resides). The sample-free project, which comes with 5 Booth-exclusive bonus tracks, is dedicated to INTLMC's late grandfather, in honor of the impact that his musical influence played on the production style that International practices today. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n01.\nThe INTLMC Intro\n02.\nIt's Your World (Remix)\n03.\nChicago Blues\n04.\nINTLMC Hidden Track One\n05.\nThe Intermission Interlude\n06.\nThank You Alicia Myers\n07.\nINTLMC Hidden Track Two\n08.\nILLA X INTLMC\n09.\nFeelings Change\n10.\nCalling You (No Answer)\n11.\nMemories Fade\n12.\nINTLMC Hidden Track Three\n13.\nAyeMan\n14.\nGeto Hayes\n15.\nLive Another for You","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:682178057c6a8292afe4264a92a2219c2006a1d5","amp;dn":"Mr.+International+-+The+International+BeatTape","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"682178057c6a8292afe4264a92a2219c2006a1d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,33,120,5,124,106,130,146,175,228,38,74,146,162,33,156,32,6,161,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
