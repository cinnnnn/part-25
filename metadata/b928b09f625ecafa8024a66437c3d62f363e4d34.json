Burroughs, and is about an android who wishes to be human, but never can be.\n\nThe song has been a regular feature at Numan's live shows since his first tour in 1979, and appears on the majority of his live albums.\nIn 1981 Numan wrote new lyrics to the tune of &quot;Metal&quot; for his album Dance, and renamed the song &quot;Moral&quot;. Numan often performs this version. The song was reworked into his aggressive new style in 1998, and this version is still being performed today. &quot;Metal&quot; has been covered by many artists, including Nine Inch Nails on their Things Falling Apart album (2000) and Afrika Bambaataa (with Numan himself) on Dark Matter Moving at the Speed of Light (2004).\n\nGary Numan (born Gary Anthony James Webb on 8 March 1958) is an English singer, composer, and musician, most widely known for his chart-topping 1979 hits &quot;Are 'Friends' Electric?&quot; (as Tubeway Army) and &quot;Cars&quot;. His signature sound consisted of heavy synthesiser hooks fed through guitar effects pedals.\n\nNuman is considered a pioneer of commercial electronic music. His use of themes from science fiction, and his combination of aggressive punk energy with electronics, have been widely imitated.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(Gary_Numan_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(Gary_Numan_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAaJEaAEc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAaJEaAEc&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 9000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:51\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
