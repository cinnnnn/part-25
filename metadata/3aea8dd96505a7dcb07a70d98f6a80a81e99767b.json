Capitol Records originally titled the song &quot;You're Gonna Lose That Girl&quot; in the United States \n\nThe song was released in 1965 on the Help album. In November 1977, Capitol Records scheduled the release of &quot;Girl&quot; backed with &quot;You're Gonna Lose That Girl&quot; as a single (Capitol 4506) to accompany the release of Love Songs, a compilation album which contained both songs. However, the single was cancelled before it was issued.\n\nComposition and recording:\n\nThe last song recorded before breaking off to make the film, the song was composed at Lennon's house in Weybridge. In the lyrics the singer tells his &quot;friend&quot; that, if he does not value his girl, the singer will &quot;make a point of taking her away&quot; from him. To the Beatles' familiar twist beat and using variations of familiar doo-wop chords, Lennon's lead singing is set in a call-and-response with the enthusiastic answering harmonies of McCartney and George Harrison, offering a last glimpse of the early Beatles' musical home turf.\n\nThe song's bridge has a key change similar to that of the record's previous track &quot;Another Girl&quot;, moving up a minor third to G major, the relative major of the tonic minor. In this case the bridge emerges a measure early, diving a semitone down to meet the verse.\n\nTo fatten the sound McCartney overdubbed a background piano (a job that once would have been done by producer George Martin &quot;live&quot; on the backing track) and Ringo Starr added bongoes, the addition of Latin-American percussion being another way the Beatles often exploited their new-found access to four-track recording.\n\nIn the film Help!:\n\nIn the film, the group appears singing this song in the recording studio. (In addition to the group's familiar guitar-and-drum setup, there is also footage of Paul McCartney at a piano and Ringo Starr playing the bongos, both miming instruments they had overdubbed onto the recording.) Towards the end, one of the thugs uses a chainsaw to saw a hole in the floor around the drum kit. The producer reports that they will have to re-record the song due to a buzzing noise, at which point The Beatles begin asking one another who was buzzing. As they look to Ringo, he and the drums fall through the floor.\n\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the rock music era. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You're_Going_to_Lose_That_Girl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You're_Going_to_Lose_That_Girl&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GAfKkaAFL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GAfKkaAFL&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (16:9) 25fps 9800kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:02:18\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
