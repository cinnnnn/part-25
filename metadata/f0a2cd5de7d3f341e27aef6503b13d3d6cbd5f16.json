It seems there is 1 other torrent for this game however it is entirely dead so I&amp;#039;ve decided to create fresh .iso&amp;#039;s and make an entirely brand new torrent for it.\n\nBeyond Atlantis II: New Worlds Await You...\n\nAtlantis III (Known as Beyond Atlantis II in USA) is a fantasy adventure computer game developed by Cryo Interactive and published by Dreamcatcher Interactive, and released in 2001. The game is entirely mouse driven. The only key you will ever push is ESC to access the menu to change options and exit the game.\n\nInstructions / Information\n\n- Disc 1 is not used for gameplay, it is only used to install the game.\n\n- Once you have successfully installed the game, mount Disc 2 and start the game. As you progress further in to the game you will later be asked to use Disc 3.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s a beautiful game!\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0a2cd5de7d3f341e27aef6503b13d3d6cbd5f16","amp;dn":"Beyond+Atlantis+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0a2cd5de7d3f341e27aef6503b13d3d6cbd5f16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,162,205,93,231,211,243,65,226,122,239,101,3,177,61,61,108,189,95,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
