The original eight-song program has been joined by &quot;A Portrait of Jennie&quot; by the same trio (pianist Red Garland, bassist Sam Jones and drummer Art Taylor) from an earlier date. Most unusual about the set is that Garland makes a rare (and effective) appearance on organ during &quot;Halleloo-Y'All.&quot; Otherwise, this is a conventional but enjoyable set of bluesy bop, highlighted by &quot;Revelation Blues,&quot; &quot;Everytime I Feel the Spirit&quot; and &quot;Rocks In My Bed.&quot; ~ Scott Yanow\n[/color]\n[color=lime]Recorded at the Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, New Jersey on April 11, 1958 and the Van Gelder Studio, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey on July 15, 1960.
