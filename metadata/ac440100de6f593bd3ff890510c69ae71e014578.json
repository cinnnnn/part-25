No more unlock plugin.\n  As for flashing, BLU is available even without any connected device, even with\n  unrecognized devices.\n- Updated SuperSU package. Added servicemnu root hack \n  (works with Z/ZL for all FW up  to .434)\n  Known working for Xperia T/V too\n- Added TA partition backup/restore. Using this feature, you can backup TA before unlock. \n  Restore TA will relock the devicee and get DRM back as well as BE2 \n  (full complete relock). You cannot count  on this feature if ever your device is \n  already unlocked. Missuse of this feature can brick the device.\n  Check XDA thread for more infos : \n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2292598&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2292598&lt;/a&gt;\n\n* 0.9.10.1\n- Resolved a serious bug leading to a softbrick (reported on LT26 devices)\n- Added a more complete german translation (thanks papayayoghurt)\n\n\nIntroduction to Flashtool:\nFlashtool is a flashing software that can be used to :\n\n1. Flash original Images (Android 1.6, 2.1, 2.3 Images)\n2. Root your phone\n3. Install Recovery, Busybox, custom kernels\n4.
