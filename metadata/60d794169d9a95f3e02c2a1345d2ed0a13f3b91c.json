Not to say that my \nmind/decisions changed very often during my work on this pl. \nThe track size changed quite often too.\nBut after sooo many hours of work I can finally say that I can share this pl. without regretting \nthat I might forget to include a track I really liked or that I could relate to...\n\nAnyway, these are the tracks that I enjoyed the most.\nDiscovered while roaming around in the internet, during albums investments, friend recommendations\n&amp; listening to other playlists.\n\nThe cover artwork was created by Emeline Couras.\n\nOf course I need to thank a few people too.\n\nThanks go out to:\nEmeline - For creating this awesome cover\nFentiger - For the interesting song recommendations, myspace conversations and his help with some\nof the playlist covers\nSamy - For the kind words &amp; for creating those awesome pl's\nBlalock - For helping me out in my times of need &amp; for the BIRP site &amp; playlists\nRebJukebox - For his support on the BIRP site &amp; for all the funny conversations\nWhipple - For his support on the BIRP site &amp; for a &quot;specific&quot; invite to a great site (;])\n\nAnd thanks to all the people who showed interest in my pl's and to everyone\nwho actually did support some of those great artists.\n\nSo, enjoy!\n\nand see you in march, I guess...\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nVA - Various Artists - daKradha's Indie Rock Playlist - Best of 2009\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: Various Artists - daKradha's Indie Rock Playlist - Best of 2009\nGenre................: Indie\nSource...............: Various\nYear.................: 2009\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 255kbps)\nTags.................: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3\n\nRipped by............: daKradha on 31.01.2010\nPosted by............: daKradha on 01.02.2010\n\nNews Server..........: http://www.lastfm.de/group/daKradha%2527s%2BIndie%2BRock%2BPlaylist\n\nIncluded.............: NFO, SFV, PLS, M3U\nCovers...............: Front \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
