They were seeking asylum since fleeing their homeland of Kosovo, where their lives were in danger due to their Roma ethnicity. Devastated by her sudden disappearance, Agnesa's friends began a vigorous campaign against the UK government, to stop her deportation and put an end to dawn raids involving children.\n\nTheir inspirational story has since been the catalyst for two BBC documentaries, a National Theatre of Scotland musical and a BBC drama.\n\nTen years on, the Glasgow Girls are back together to reflect on all the different ways their story has been told.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;266e4f414e666a150817&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 21 (~1236Kbps)\nVideo Resolution: 1024x576\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~118Kbps)\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 29 mins\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 288 MB\nSource: HDTV\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff7aeab26e7793bda8000ac8be29eb6483a45359","amp;dn":"The.Glasgow.Girls.Stories.576p.HDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff7aeab26e7793bda8000ac8be29eb6483a45359","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,122,234,178,110,119,147,189,168,0,10,200,190,41,235,100,131,164,83,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
