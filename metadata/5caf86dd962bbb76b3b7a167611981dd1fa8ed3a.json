With Christmas only weeks away, the aging king is ready to pass his throne to the Crown Prince, Nick St. Nicholas (Kelsey Grammer). But the sexy Santa-to-be is a no-show heir with other priorities - his lavish seaside estate, leggy newswoman Heidi Gardelle (Elaine Hendrix), and public relations expert Hector Villarba (Luis Garcia). Heidi and Hector may not know Nick's true identity, but they do know that he is the prince of benefits. Their plan? Use his knockout connections to create an on-line holiday charity. Nick's all for it. Unfortunately, the problems are just beginning. A charge of fraud has turned Nick's charity into a nationwide scandal. What's it going to take to prevent Christmas from becoming a dim memory? Nothing short of a miracle.\n\n\nTAGLINE:\n\n\nSure the Santa thing is changing his life,but he's still the life of the party.\n\n\nAll stand-alone divx players compatible\n\n\nENJOY &amp; PLEASE SEED FOR AS LONG AS U CAN !!!! \n\n\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.
