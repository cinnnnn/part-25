Then shows how the killing was done.\nIncludes testimony from soldiers and Vietnamese. Also explores the role the United States played in supporting and propping up the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq during the 1960's.\n\nFile info:\nFile Size:.......... 1,261,254,656\nDuration:........... 1:26:48\n\nSubtype:............
