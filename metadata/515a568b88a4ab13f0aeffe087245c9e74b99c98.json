Until DI Wesley Peterson learns of a legend involving a French woman who burned to death there in the thirteenth century. And when he discovers that records of a previous excavation on the site have vanished, and that two archaeologists involved in that dig died in tragic circumstances, Wesley starts to investigate the possibility of a link between the legend and recent events. But edging closer to the truth brings unexpected danger to Wesley. For the truth echoes a story of twisted love and obsession from many centuries ago - a truth that almost costs Wesley his life . . .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:515a568b88a4ab13f0aeffe087245c9e74b99c98","amp;dn":"Kate+Ellis-A+Perfect+Death","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"515a568b88a4ab13f0aeffe087245c9e74b99c98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,90,86,139,136,164,171,19,240,174,255,224,135,36,92,158,116,185,156,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
