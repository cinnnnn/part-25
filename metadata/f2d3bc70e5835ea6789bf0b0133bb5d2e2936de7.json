The story was made into the famous Twilight Zone episode &quot;It's a Good Life&quot; in 1953, and was re-dramatized in 2004 as a high-quality radio drama of the same name, which stayed much closer to the original story.\n\nThe story is difficult to come by. Thanks to the good people of mIRC for making the text available. I am uploading it here in .rtf format because the italicized words are so important to the meaning of the story. If you pass it on, please do so in .rtf or better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2d3bc70e5835ea6789bf0b0133bb5d2e2936de7","amp;dn":"It%5C%27s+a+Good+Life+by+Jerome+Bixby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2d3bc70e5835ea6789bf0b0133bb5d2e2936de7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,211,188,112,229,131,94,166,120,155,240,176,19,59,181,210,226,147,109,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
