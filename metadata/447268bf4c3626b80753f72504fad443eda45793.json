The song was later included on the album Welcome to the Pleasuredome (1984).\n\nAlthough fairly inauspicious upon initial release, &quot;Relax&quot; finally reached number one in the UK singles chart on 24 January 1984, ultimately becoming one of the most controversial and most commercially successful records of the entire decade. The single eventually sold a reported 1.91 million copies in the UK alone, making it the seventh best-selling single in UK singles chart history. Following the release of the group's second single, &quot;Two Tribes&quot;, &quot;Relax&quot; rallied from a declining UK chart position during June 1984 to climb back up the UK charts and re-attain number two spot behind &quot;Two Tribes&quot; at number one, representing simultaneous chart success by a single act unprecedented since the early 1960s.\n\nUpon release in the United States in late 1984, &quot;Relax&quot; repeated its slow UK progress, reaching number 67 upon initial release, but eventually reaching number 10 in March 1985.\n\nThe song won Best British Single at the 1985 Brit Awards.\n\nThe song is used in the film Zoolander, in which it is the trigger for the main character to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia. The song was also featured in the game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, and a 2009 TV advert for Virgin Atlantic, marking 25 years since the company's foundation.\n\nWelcome to the Pleasuredome was the debut album by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, first released in the UK in October 1984 by ZTT/Island Records. Originally issued as a vinyl double album, it was assured of a UK chart entry at number one due to reported advance sales of over one million.\n\nWhilst commercially successful, the album also drew criticism for containing new versions of the group's (already much-remixed) hit singles from the same year (&quot;Relax&quot; and &quot;Two Tribes&quot;, plus B-side &quot;War&quot;), as well as a surfeit of cover versions in lieu of much new original material.\n\nHowever, the album's evergreen ballad &quot;The Power of Love&quot; would subsequently provide the group with their third consecutive UK number one single.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:447268bf4c3626b80753f72504fad443eda45793","amp;dn":"Frankie+Goes+To+Hollywood+-+Relax+%28Live%29++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"447268bf4c3626b80753f72504fad443eda45793","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,114,104,191,76,54,38,184,7,83,247,37,4,250,212,67,237,164,87,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
