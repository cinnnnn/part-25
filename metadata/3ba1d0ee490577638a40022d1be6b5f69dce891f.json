Shorelines, water and landclass problems. \n\nI use UT-EU as well (1.1 updated!!). I applied the included UT-EU patch. After restart i was shocked, it looked terrible^^ \nBut i use lwmviewer2 and find out, that the file HP950160_FCBP_EX.bgl (Flight Simulator 9\\Scenery\\Eurw\\Scenery) made problems, so i delted it. Now it looks fine. One small problem i found on the south of the island, a very small piece of land was missplaced, i think this is a flatten problem.\n\nUse at own risk. No flames allowed. \n\nIf you have any scenery problems, i can highly recommend lwmviewer:\njimkeir.co.uk/FlightSim/LWMViewer2.html\n\nIts a beta, and its work not 100% well, but its enough to find out which scenery objects make trouble, you can spot and just delete or rename the files. \n\nIn programm, (start fs9 and go to your problem area) click on center on plane (or press home key), press f7 and check or unchek the elements till you see that your missplaced will disapear. Rightklick on filename, you can open the folder and mark the file direct. Close fs9 and rename...\n\nThis is for advanced users of fs9, and whwn you shold have problems with elba or lwmviewer, you should not use it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ba1d0ee490577638a40022d1be6b5f69dce891f","amp;dn":"FS2004+Life+in+Elba%2C+inc.+SP1+and+UT-EU+patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ba1d0ee490577638a40022d1be6b5f69dce891f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,161,208,238,73,5,119,99,138,64,2,45,27,230,181,246,157,206,137,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
