A short list would range from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith No More and Living Colour to Anthrax, Rage Against the Machine, 24-7 Spyz and Sevendust. What separates Mister Jones apart from the pack are its power-pop leanings. While those bands have often favored brute force and a forceful, metallic attrack, Mister Jones combines hip-hop and reggae with melodic pop/rock on its promising debut album, Hail Mary. Infectious, catchy hooks are the rule on &quot;Roses and Daisies,&quot; &quot;Destiny,&quot; &quot;Right Hand Man&quot; and other tunes that make Hail Mary the engaging, fun offering that it is. A few reviewers noted some parallels between Mister Jones and Chumbawamba, and that isn't a bad comparison on &quot;What Now&quot; and &quot;Uncle Bill's Ride.&quot; But whatever comparisons one chooses to make, the bottom line is that Mister Jones is a risk-taking band with an appealing and recognizable personality of its own.
