If you see me uploading single issues, this means that regretfully, I don't have the series yet complete.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nPPS: If you want to request a comic, please make a post here: https://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=51\nand add as title something like [scanlation] title_of_comic.\nIt makes it easier for me to keep track of requests :P\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nNote:\n\nIf you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).\nThen, you can use &quot;.cbr files and open them with ComicRack.\nIt's easy to use, and has a great quality!\n\nHope you enjoy!\t\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor other comics, you can check my release thread:     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&lt;/a&gt;\nHere the most recent versions of the torrents will be referenced. You can also indicate which series you rather want to read more of. Just comment on a torrent, rate the torrent or send me a message/PM on suprbay, and you'll be able to read it in about one month!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d17001f813b696293babc6a02d79e11fb83c11be","amp;dn":"The+Chninkel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d17001f813b696293babc6a02d79e11fb83c11be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,112,1,248,19,182,150,41,59,171,198,160,45,121,225,31,184,60,17,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
