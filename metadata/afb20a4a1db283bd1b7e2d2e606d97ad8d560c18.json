For 400 years it sat abandoned on its misty cliff, the quintessential lost city in the jungle. Rediscovered in 1911, it contained no written records or carvings, nothing that could shed light on its history. For a century since, it has defied the endless scores of visitors and scientists who attempted to understand its purpose. \n\nWho were the mysterious people who built it and why did they build it here? Today an international team of archeologists, engineers and scientists are finally piecing together the clues. Together they are discovering astonishing new burials, revealing the intricacies of its ingenious engineering and finally decoding the secrets of Machu Picchu. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by : Craig Sechler \n===========================\n\n\nProduced &amp; Written by: Owen Palmquist &amp; Ricardo Preve\n=====================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Machu Picchu Decoded\nYear.................:    2010\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:52:28\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    704x400\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1985 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A)\nFile Size:...........:    745 MB\nFPS..................:    25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    5 July 2010\n\n\n\n\n   \n  \n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         **** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afb20a4a1db283bd1b7e2d2e606d97ad8d560c18","amp;dn":"Machu+Picchu+Decoded-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afb20a4a1db283bd1b7e2d2e606d97ad8d560c18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,178,10,74,29,178,131,189,27,126,45,46,96,109,151,173,141,86,12,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
