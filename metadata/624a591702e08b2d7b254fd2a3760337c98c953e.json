Recorded in Jonathan Wilsonâ€™s Fivestar Studios in Echo Park, California, it was co-produced by the Chapin Sisters, bass player Dan Horne, and drummer Jesse Lee, the latter two of whom also provide the rhythm section. With a full band on hand, including guests on guitar and keyboard, the album mixes sounds of folk, Americana, and â€™70s soft rock, with the sistersâ€™ rich vocal harmonies anchoring the route. Standouts include the noirish â€œAutumn,â€ the piano-enlivened â€œTrees Fall Around,â€ and a countrified farewell to L.A., â€œAngeleno,â€ featuring pedal steel by Horne.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01.
