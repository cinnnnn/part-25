The characters first appeared in a special insert in The New Teen Titans #16 (February 1982), which was shortly followed by getting its own series, which was published from 1982 to 1983. The Zoo Crew characters were created by Roy Thomas and Scott Shaw. Although the series, which was the last original funny animal property created by DC Comics, proved short-lived (lasting only 20 issues), it is still fondly remembered by many comic fans of its generation, and the characters appear occasionally in cameos in the mainstream DC Universe.\n\nA Showcase Presents reprinting of the entire series was slated for September 2007, but has been postponed along with several other Showcase editions due to royalty issues in DC&amp;#039;s contracts of the 1980s.\n\nIn October 2007 a three-issue series called &quot;Captain Carrot and the Final Ark&quot; began, featuring the Zoo Crew some time after the Teen Titans storyline.[/quote]\n\nTeen Titans v3 030-031\n[quote]Here are the pages from Teen Titans v3 #30 and #31 collected together without the Titans pages.[/quote]\n\nThe Oz-Wonderland War &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/9545/capozlx4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/9545/capozlx4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[quote]The basic thrust of the story is that the Nome King has captured and imprisoned several prominent citizens of Oz, including Ozma, Glenda, and Nick Chopper among others. He&amp;#039;s further gained control of the flying monkeys and, through them, Oz itself. The inhabitants of Wonderland are concerned, naturally enough, that he&amp;#039;ll soon see wage war against them as well. So the Cheshire Cat heads out in search of some new champions to help save those who&amp;#039;ve been captured and depose the Nome King.[/quote]\n\nCaptain Carrot And The Final Ark &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img442.imageshack.us/img442/8571/2m3sbo8gt2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img442.imageshack.us/img442/8571/2m3sbo8gt2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[quote]The Zoo Crew is back in a 3-issue COUNTDOWN tie-in miniseries! Captain Carrot reunites the team to face a threat that begins at the &quot;Sandy Eggo Comic-Con&quot; and quickly menaces the entire world ! The gang&amp;#039;s all here: Fastback, Pig-Iron, Yankee Poodle, American Eagle, Alley-Kat-Abra, and the Captain himself, taking on the Salamandroid!\n\nNot a &quot;kiddie comic&quot; -- but, like THE SIMPSONS and ROCKY AND HIS FRIENDS, with a &quot;multi-tiered sense of humor&quot; that appeals to younger readers as well -- CAPTAIN CARROT AND THE FINAL ARK explores a world of &quot;funny animals&quot; that mirrors (and parodies) those of more traditional comic books. Captain Carrot (secretly cartoonist Rodney R. Rabbit) leads a team of animal superheroes, the Zoo Crew -- which includes Pig-Iron, Alley-Kat-Abra, Rubberduck, Yankee Poodle, Fastback and American Eagle -- as they face the threat of marine terrorists who are at the forefront of a planet-wide war between land-dwelling critters and the inhabitants of &quot;Earth-26&amp;#039;s&quot; oceans. Along the way, we make fun of comic book conventions, J. J. Abrams&amp;#039; upcoming giant monster movie, DC&amp;#039;s 52 and COUNTDOWN series (for which CAPTAIN CARROT AND THE FINAL ARK is actually an official tie-in), death in comics, lawyers, Tex Avery, Sergio AragonÃƒÂ©s, Prince, Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth, Jack Kirby&amp;#039;s NEW GODS and much more. And the series&amp;#039; finale features a HUGE surprise that, once and for all, establishes the Zoo Crew&amp;#039;s ties to the &quot;regular&quot; DC universe.[/quote]\n\nBIG THANKS to all the scanners involved.\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE BOOK, THEN BUY THE COMICS OR THE TRADES.
