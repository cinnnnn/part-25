From the sublime and ridiculous to the truly mortifying, these snapshot anecdotes are all 100 per cent genuine, and very, very funny.\n\n'Today, my mother and I got into a huge fight about me being a lesbian. It ended with me saying 'Fuck you!' to which she responded, 'I bet you'd probably like to!&quot; - &quot;FML&quot;. 'Today, I was volunteering at a nursing home and I was calling bingo numbers. One woman stood up and started making noises. I assumed she had won and I started clapping. She then fell on the floor and died of a heart attack. I essentially applauded her death' - &quot;FML&quot;. 'Today, I fell asleep. I felt something on my face. I batted it away. It was my hamster. It died from hitting the wall' - &quot;FML&quot;.

She was talking about a fictional vampire' - &quot;FML&quot;.
