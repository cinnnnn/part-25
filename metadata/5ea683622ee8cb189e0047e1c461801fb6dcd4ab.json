Biebs turning down a gig. After a quick song, Dave bitches about Twitter, we see a clip from Rick Sanchez and the â€œShorty Awards,â€ Dave puts Twitter on the Shizer List, The Irish Cobra hisses at Twitter, and Dave sings a song to Roy. Dave goes on to talk about King of Kong, Finn Balor and his son, they engage in a little Finn Balor action, ESD talks about Big A, being broke and living with his parents, we hear from Shock Jock Robot, and the gang engage in a tune. Dave talks about Albert Pujols, Flutesy plays her mysterious song, we have â€œtickle time,â€ Sean O. Barry gives up a gift, we hear a number two ditty, they play â€œsuck or fuck,â€ Big A takes over, and the gang sings us out","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ea683622ee8cb189e0047e1c461801fb6dcd4ab","amp;dn":"East+Side+Dave+Show+2016-08-03","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ea683622ee8cb189e0047e1c461801fb6dcd4ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,166,131,98,46,232,203,24,158,0,71,225,196,97,128,31,182,220,212,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
