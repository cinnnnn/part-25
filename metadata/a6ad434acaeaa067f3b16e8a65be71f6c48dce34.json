This introduction to programming and the Objective-C language is the first step on your journey from someone who uses apps to someone who writes them.\n\nBased on Big Nerd Ranch's legendary Objective-C Bootcamp,Ã‚Â¿this book covers C, Objective-C, and the common programming idioms that enable developers to make the most of Apple technologies.\n\nThis is the only introductory-level book written by Aaron Hillegass, one of the most experienced and authoritative voices in the iOS and Cocoa community.\n\nCompatible with Xcode 4.2, iOS 5, and Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), this guide features short chapters and engaging style to keep you motivated and moving forward. At the same time, AaronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determination that you understand what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doingÃ¢â‚¬â€or at least why youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing itÃ¢â‚¬â€encourages you to think critically as a programmer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6ad434acaeaa067f3b16e8a65be71f6c48dce34","amp;dn":"Objective-C+Programming%3A+The+Big+Nerd+Ranch+Guide+%28Big+Nerd+Ranc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6ad434acaeaa067f3b16e8a65be71f6c48dce34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,173,67,74,202,234,160,103,243,177,110,138,101,190,113,246,196,141,206,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
