That story is of course about a puppet who, after many trials, succeeds in becoming a Ã¢â‚¬Å“real boy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Yet it is hardly a sentimental or morally improving tale. To the contrary, Pinocchio is one of the great subversives of the written page, a madcap genius hurtled along at the pleasure and mercy of his desires, a renegade who in many ways resembles his near contemporary Huck Finn.\n\nPinocchio the novel, no less than Pinocchio the character, is one of the great inventions of modern literature. A sublime anomaly, the book merges the traditions of the picaresque, of street theater, and of folk and fairy tales into a work that is at once adventure, satire, and a powerful enchantment that anticipates surrealism and magical realism. Thronged with memorable characters and composed with the fluid but inevitable logic of a dream, Pinocchio is an endlessly fascinating work that is essential equipment for life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de2d2d37cbe6e947921ac41b9633ba754f0af1ca","amp;dn":"Pinocchio+-+Carlo+Collodi.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de2d2d37cbe6e947921ac41b9633ba754f0af1ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,45,45,55,203,230,233,71,146,26,196,27,150,51,186,117,79,10,241,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
