Standing there, looking out to sea, and is she waiting there for me...&quot;\n\nThe song was somewhat controversial in some circles, as its subject, singing while cleaning his gun, admits to being &quot;so afraid of dying&quot;.\n\nWebb admitted in interviews that he didn't have the Vietnam War in mind when he wrote the song, as he imagined it taking place during a battle of the Spanish-American War, the time period when the City of Galveston reached its civic peak. However, it was widely perceived as a protest song, which is also underlined in the original promo video as Campbell is dressed up in a military outfit.\n\nThis song made the CMT list of the ten greatest country-western songs of all time. The popular crossover single also made #4 on the Billboard Hot 100, and #1 on the country music and &quot;Easy Listening&quot; charts.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88b95ab25474c8851ccfbcc1b742e3a6b286fd30","amp;dn":"Glen+Campbell+-+Galveston","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88b95ab25474c8851ccfbcc1b742e3a6b286fd30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,185,90,178,84,116,200,133,28,207,188,193,183,66,227,166,178,134,253,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
