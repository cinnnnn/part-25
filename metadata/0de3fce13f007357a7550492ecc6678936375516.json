Their performances are interesting; it's only too bad that they have such turbid and inconclusive things to do. After a while, the mad confusion of the story inspires a complete apathy.&quot;\n\nMore recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz liked the film, writing, &quot;A dark moody noir tale about a marine who gets blown up by a grenade in the South Pacific during a skirmish in WW-II and survives, only to become an amnesia victim ... Mankiewicz does a nice job of creating the dark noir mood. The film is spiced up with comedy, excellent performances, plenty of suspense, plus a tense voice-over by John Ireland, and it manages to keep the pot boiling with a quintessential amnesiac story.&quot;\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 340 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 110 mins\nSubtitles: Eng, Francais, Espanol\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0de3fce13f007357a7550492ecc6678936375516","amp;dn":"Somewhere+in+the+Night+%281946%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Subs-Eng-Espanol+-+John","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0de3fce13f007357a7550492ecc6678936375516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,227,252,225,63,0,115,87,167,85,4,146,236,198,103,137,54,55,85,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
