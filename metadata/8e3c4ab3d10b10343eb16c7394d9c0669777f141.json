YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll meet a woman in her mid-thirties pining for her mean-spirited, abusive boyfriend, Del, a nine-year-old who is in no way her actual boyfriend. And just try to resist the noir story of a reluctant, Afrin-addled detective.\n\nSelf-loathing, self-loving, and otherwise trapped by their own dumb selves, these characters make one cringe-worthy mistake after another. But for each bone-headed move, Hunter delivers a surprising moment that chokes you up as you peer into what seemed like deep emptiness and discover a profound longing for human understanding. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the collision of these moments that make this a powerful, alive book.\n\nThe stories of DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Kiss Me are united by HunterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singular voice and unflinching eye. By turns crass and tender, heartbreaking and devastatingly funny, her stories expose a world full of characters seemingly driven by desperation, but in the end, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the ones who get the last laugh. Hunter is at the forefront of the boldest, most provocative writers working now.\n\nGenre: Fiction, Short Stories","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e3c4ab3d10b10343eb16c7394d9c0669777f141","amp;dn":"Don%27t+Kiss+Me+by+Lindsay+Hunter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e3c4ab3d10b10343eb16c7394d9c0669777f141","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,60,74,179,209,11,16,52,62,177,108,115,148,217,192,102,151,119,241,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
