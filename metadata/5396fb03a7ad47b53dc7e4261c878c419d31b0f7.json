Able to change the atomic properties of anything that is non-organic, Firestorm first burst onto the DC Comics scene in 1978 and the character (if not the same people) have been lighting the worl on nuclear fire ever since!\n\nI hope this works! This collection includes Firestorm v1, his DC Comics Presents and Brave and the Bold appearances, his JLA joining issue, the cancelled comic cavalcade issue #6 as well as the Flash v1 back-ups! Enjoy this and please seed.\n\nTony","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5396fb03a7ad47b53dc7e4261c878c419d31b0f7","amp;dn":"Firestorm+-+Vol.+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5396fb03a7ad47b53dc7e4261c878c419d31b0f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,150,251,3,167,173,71,181,61,199,228,38,28,135,140,65,157,49,176,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
