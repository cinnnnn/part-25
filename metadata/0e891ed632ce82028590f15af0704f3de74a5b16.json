Awake Unto, on the other hand, ventures boldly into folk-rock territory more than once: neither of the full-blooded â€˜Golden Ageâ€™ and â€˜In My Wakeâ€™ would seem out of place on Strange Friend, while the 50s-tinged â€˜The Night is All Oursâ€™ strays further still from the beaten path.\r\nBut itâ€™s when Redbeardâ€™s clear-as-a-bell voice is allowed to resonate boldly through the reverb and the subtle strings that this record finds its finest moments. â€˜Unfoundâ€™, the â€˜Field Yearsâ€™ and â€˜Yuki Onnaâ€™ are a haunting, ethereal trio, while the gothic â€˜What Fine Peopleâ€™ is one of the finest in his canon. The plaintive air of the debut remains, but is elevated by the occasional harmony and wheeze of reed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01. Wild Young Country.flac \r\n02.
