This atlas fills the information gap between descriptive anatomy and pathology and helps the student make the link between the two. It addresses the clinical appearance of normal tissues and their function and provides guidance on how to examine and assess normal joints.\nThe Atlas of Orthopedic Examination of the Peripheral Joints provides an invaluable source of reference to the members of all health care professions concerned with the management of orthopaedic problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e9502fc6cffe57562b74288dd5b220db0786533","amp;dn":"Atlas+of+Orthopedic+Examination+of+the+Peripheral+Joints","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e9502fc6cffe57562b74288dd5b220db0786533","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,149,2,252,108,255,229,117,98,183,66,136,221,91,34,13,176,120,101,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
