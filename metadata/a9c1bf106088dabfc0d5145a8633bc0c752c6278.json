In the waiting room of an abortion clinic, the quirky and whip-sharp Juno decides to give birth and to place the child with an adoptive couple. She finds one in the PennySaver personals, contacts them, tells her dad and step-mother, and carries on with school. The chosen parents, upscale yuppies (one of whom is cool and laid back, the other meticulous and uptight), meet Juno, sign papers, and the year unfolds. Will Juno's plan work, can she improvise, and what about Bleeker?\n\n\nplease visit us at www.The-Commission.com \nwww.reputation-resource.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9c1bf106088dabfc0d5145a8633bc0c752c6278","amp;dn":"Juno+DVDRip++%28A+Commission-kvcd+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9c1bf106088dabfc0d5145a8633bc0c752c6278","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,193,191,16,96,136,218,191,192,213,20,90,134,51,188,12,117,44,98,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
