And then there's the extraordinary Edgar Winter himself, younger brother of bluesman Johnny, and also an albino.\n\nThe single of the classic jazz/rock track 'Frankenstein' made it to the top of the US charts in 73, but it was pallid in comparison to the LP version here. The Winter Group played the tune for British TV at the time -- on the 'Old Grey Whistle Test' -- and it was a virtuoso, multi-instrumental performance, with Winter dashing between saxophone, timbales and ARP synth.\n\nThe two other great reasons for buying this album are the well-crafted 'Undercover Man' and 'Rock'N'Roll Boogie Woogie Blues'. The guitar work throughout this album is superb, but with both Montrose and Derringer present, what else could you expect?\n[/quote]\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Edgar Winter Group, The - They Only Come Out at Night (EK 31584)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Edgar Winter Group, The\nAlbum................: They Only Come Out at Night (EK 31584)\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1972\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 263kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
