These four different types of activities are found in each book: story-based mysteries, activities that discover the mysteries found in mathematics, rhyming riddles, and &quot;crack-the-code&quot; problems. All activities are identified in the table of contents with the NCTM standards. Activities integrate problem-solving with numbers and operations and can be used in a variety of ways. The forty engaging activities can be assigned individually, in pairs, as small group assignments, or can be solved together by the whole class. Students are also challenged to create their own math mysteries for others to solve. As students begin to think and write mathematically, they will enjoy the challenge found in each activity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eecb019f852db177826a5ee899823f804ea1545","amp;dn":"Math+Mysteries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eecb019f852db177826a5ee899823f804ea1545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,236,176,25,248,82,219,23,120,38,165,238,137,152,35,248,4,234,21,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
