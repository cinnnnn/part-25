A valuable addition to any music lovers collection.\nTop-drawerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦essential viewingÃ¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Guardian\n\nProduced in association with the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading orchestras, opera houses and musicians. Told through a 25,000 mile journey along every route Mozart followed; IN SEARCH OF MOZART is a detective story that travels to the heart of old EuropeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and the heart of genius itself.\n\nI loved every minute of itÃ¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Time\n\nNarrated by Juliet Stevenson and featuring: Ronald Brautigam, RenÃƒÂ©e Fleming, Magdalena KoÃ…Â¾enÃƒÂ¡, Lang Lang, Louis LangrÃƒÂ©e, Julian Rachlin, Roger Norrington, Imogen Cooper, Ã…Â kampa Quartet, Orchestra of the 18th Century, the Salzburg CamerataÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and many other leading musicians, performers, and Mozart experts.\n\nWithout resorting to docu-drama or visual re-enactment, In Search of Mozart traces the composerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life through his music and extensive correspondence. From K1a to K626 (Requiem), over 80 works are featured in chronological order, revealing striking parallels between the music and MozartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own experiences. Throughout, it is the music that takes centre stage, with the jigsaw of MozartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life fitting around it. With rigorous analysis from musicologists and experts such as Jonathan Miller, Cliff Eisen, Nicholas Till, Bayan Northcott and the late Stanley Sadie, a new, vivid impression of the composer emerges. It dispels the many common myths about MozartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genius, health, relationships, death and character, to present a new image, very different from Milos FormanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Amadeus.\n\nNarrated by Juliet Stevenson and with Mozart voiced by Samuel West, the film features interviews and performances with over 70 of the greatest exponents of MozartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music including: Christophe Rousset, Sir Roger Norrington, RenÃƒÂ© Jacobs, Sir Charles Mackerras, RenÃƒÂ©e Fleming, Magdalena KoÃ…Â¾enÃƒÂ¡, Sandrine Piau, Ian Bostridge, Gerald Finley, Sir Thomas Allen, Imogen Cooper, Pierre Laurent Aimard, Leif ove Andsnes, Lang Lang and Ã…Â kampa Quartet. Frans BruggenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Orchestra of 18th Century and Ronald Brautigam perform much of the orchestral repertoire but the film also includes live performances from the Vienna Philharmonic, Norwegian Chamber Orchestra, Academy of St Martin in the Fields, Salzburg Camerata, Bayerischen Rundfunks, Concerto KÃƒÂ¶ln, Netherlands Opera, Staatskapelle Berlin and Prague Estates Theatre.\n\n\n*****\n\nSource: DVD\nAudio: AC3\nVideo: MPEG-2\nResolution: 720 x 480","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90cb5f56c73940b9188cc0c8fa763e994ff56581","amp;dn":"In+Search+of+Mozart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90cb5f56c73940b9188cc0c8fa763e994ff56581","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,203,95,86,199,57,64,185,24,140,192,200,250,118,62,153,79,245,101,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
