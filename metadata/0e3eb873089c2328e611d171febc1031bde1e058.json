With an exhaustive knowledge of popular culture and an almost effortless ability to spin brilliant prose out of unlikely subject matter, Klosterman attacks the entire spectrum of postmodern America: reality TV, Internet porn, Pamela Anderson, literary Jesus freaks, and the real difference between apples and oranges (of which there is none). And donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even get him started on his love life and the whole Harry-Met-Sally situation.\n\nWhether deconstructing Saved by the Bell episodes or the artistic legacy of Billy Joel, the symbolic importance of The Empire Strikes Back or the Celtics/Lakers rivalry, Chuck will make you think, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make you laugh, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll drive you insaneÃ¢â‚¬â€usually all at once. Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs is ostensibly about art, entertainment, infotainment, sports, politics, and kittens, butÃ¢â‚¬â€reallyÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about us. All of us. As Klosterman realizes late at night, in the moment before he falls asleep, Ã¢â‚¬Å“In and of itself, nothing really matters. What matters is that nothing is ever Ã¢â‚¬Ëœin and of itself.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Read to believe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e3eb873089c2328e611d171febc1031bde1e058","amp;dn":"Sex%2C+Drugs%2C+and+Cocoa+Puffs%3A+A+Low+Culture+Manifesto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e3eb873089c2328e611d171febc1031bde1e058","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,62,184,115,8,156,35,40,230,17,209,113,254,188,16,49,189,225,224,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
