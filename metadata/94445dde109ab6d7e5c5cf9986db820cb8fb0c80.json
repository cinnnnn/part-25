The existing texts on this subject are theoretical in nature and only deal with how the equipment functions when in good mechanical conditions, from the viewpoint of the equipment vendor. In this much-anticipated volume, one of the most well-respected and prolific process engineers in the world takes on troubleshooting vacuum systems, and especially steam ejectors, an extremely complex and difficult subject that greatly effects the profitability of the majority of the world's refineries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94445dde109ab6d7e5c5cf9986db820cb8fb0c80","amp;dn":"Troubleshooting+Vacuum+Systems+-+Norman+P.+Lieberman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94445dde109ab6d7e5c5cf9986db820cb8fb0c80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,68,93,222,16,154,182,215,229,197,207,153,134,219,130,12,184,251,12,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
