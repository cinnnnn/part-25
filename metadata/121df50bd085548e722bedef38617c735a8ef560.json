This is her true story. During a terrifying journey that began as a 14-year-old armed robber, she has been shot four times, tasered three times by police and served three jail terms. Convicted for armed robbery she was released from prison only to go out and attempt to murder four people. Gypsy Jane has led a life packed with crime, betrayal, drugs and murder but she classes herself as a woman of principles: she values loyalty and honour, and has only ever wanted a Ã¢â‚¬ËœnormalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:121df50bd085548e722bedef38617c735a8ef560","amp;dn":"Jane+Lee+-+Gypsy+Jane+%28Mobi+%2B+Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"121df50bd085548e722bedef38617c735a8ef560","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,29,245,11,208,133,84,142,114,43,237,239,56,97,124,115,90,142,245,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
