Khatra, a spirited boy, wants an electric light so he can read at night. A stoic older man, Maata, tries to wire the room. Abdallah, a youth on his way to Europe, says good-bye to his mother. Nana looks back on the death of her daughter and her trip to Europe to inform the father. A girl takes singing lessons. Rooms have small windows, looking out onto foot traffic; transistor radios provide some link beyond. Huge ships anchor in the distance. The train comes through, stopping briefly. Offering a cigarette is a gesture of hospitality. Sand dunes and the ocean dominate the landscape. Hope springs amidst small expectations.\n\n\nLanguages: French, Hassanya, Mandarin\nSub: Portuguese srt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:669d817c4643348615e4fdb4830bc1ddfa4e076d","amp;dn":"Heremakono+2002+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"669d817c4643348615e4fdb4830bc1ddfa4e076d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,157,129,124,70,67,52,134,21,228,253,180,131,11,193,221,250,78,7,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
