I'm looking for another person to rip these. My DVR is shotty and I will not be able to cap these consistently. Just looking for someone to be backup in case my DVR fails.\n\n\nTONIGHT ON THE INDEPENDENTS\n---------------------------\nWhat happens when you have an hour-long cable-TV discussion about U.S. intervention, only instead of the usual mix of Sabbath-gasbags and armchair hawks and doves, the conversation took place with military veterans? Tune into the Fox Business Network tonight at 9 p.m. ET (6 p.m. ET), and again three and five hours later, to find out. Spoiler alert: It's a helluva lot more real, funny, occasionally brutal, and frankly skeptical about war aims, politics, and funding than 95 percent of what you normally see on television.\n\nTonight's lineup on this special theme episode of The Independents includes:\n\n*  Three-war veteran and former Army First Lieutenant Bryan Suits, now a KABC radio host, who will talk about the obfuscation surrounding the term &quot;boots on the ground,&quot; and also the futility of turning the tip of the national spear into social-working nation-builders.\n\n* Former Navy aviator and intelligence operations officer, and current Fox News correspondent Lea Gabrielle, who will offer some qualified support for President Barack Obama's military and rhetorical strategy against the Islamic State.\n\n* Former Air Force Sgt. and current editor of Breach Bang Clear David Reeder, who will talk about the many different flavors of mission creep.\n\n* Cato Institute defense/homeland-security research fellow Benjamin Friedman, who will talk about the problems associated with a huge military budget.\n\n* Retired Army Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, who will talk about how defense spending should be reformed to help improve the existing military and its missions.\n\n* Iraq War vet and former Marine Dan Caldwell of Concerned Veterans for America, who will talk about whether he would still advise young people to join the Armed Forces, and what the veterans' perspective is on Obama's latest war.\n\nIt's a frank and illuminating show, and I hope you tune in.\n\n-Matt Welch\n\nreason[.]com/blog/2014/09/26/test\n\n\nINFO\n----\nRipped with the Diamond VC500. Using the software that came packaged with the dongle. (It's called EZ Ripper.) In that software there's a &quot;DVD Standard&quot; which rips the video to .mpg at 720x480 with some terrible black bars. I load that file into AVIDemux. Cut the file into multiple parts to remove the commercials. Rejoin, crop, and resize those files using the same tool. For conversion I used MPEG4 AVC (x264), 2 pass on video and AAC (faac) on audio.\n\nI am not part of the scene. I just admire their naming standards.\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : H:MediaBrianTelevisionThe IndependentsThe Independents 2014The.Independents.2014.09.26.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4 \nFormat : MPEG-4 \nFormat profile : Base Media \nCodec ID : isom \nFile size : 352 MiB \nDuration : 42mn 17s \nOverall bit rate : 1 163 Kbps \nWriting application : Lavf54.63.104 \n\nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;85cdece2edc5c9b6abb5&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames \nCodec ID : avc1 \nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding \nDuration : 42mn 17s \nBit rate : 1 024 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 404 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Variable \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps \nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.117 \nStream size : 310 MiB (88%) \nWriting library : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912 \nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1024 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00 \n\nAudio \nID : 2 \nFormat : AAC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec \nFormat profile : LC \nCodec ID : 40 \nDuration : 42mn 17s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 38.7 MiB (11%) \nLanguage : unk \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66641b6adfc54b41671663c6392906949150bd43","amp;dn":"The.Independents.2014.09.26.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66641b6adfc54b41671663c6392906949150bd43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,100,27,106,223,197,75,65,103,22,99,198,57,41,6,148,145,80,189,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
