The first newspaper advertisement is from 1856, and told that the instrument was for sale from a shop in Falun. From the 1870s onwards, the accordion seems to have become very common. When Carl Jularbo, Swedens greatest popular artist of all times, picked out his first notes on his fathers accordion in the kitchen at the age of five, there was already an accordion tradition of several decades.\n\nCarl Jularbo used much of the repertoire that was played by the local musicians of the older generations when he had become an established recording artist. The popularity of the old hambo polskas, polkas, waltzes and hambo polkas was remarkably enduring, and lasted long into the era of gramophone records.\n\nGramophone records became increasingly popular in Sweden from the early 20th century onwards. The first accordion artist to make a gramophone recording was the renowned Oscar Sundquist (1882-1958), who lived in Stockholm. His debut was in 1906, and four years later it was followed by a large number of gramophone recordings with his younger brother Ragnar Sundquist (1892-1951), who later became even more famous.\n\nA number of accordion players from Dalarna were recorded early, but Carl Jularbo was not the first. Instead it was Arvid GranstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m from KorsnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤s near Falun, who in 1909, at the age of 22, got to make two records for the company Grammophone Concert Record in Stockholm. Many players from Dalarna followed him: Jularbo made his debut in 1913, Hugo Johansson from KorsnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤s in 1916, the brothers Erik (1916) and Carl (1919) Gylling from GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ngesberg, Carl Gustaf Johansson, The King of SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ter and Edvin Andersson from Avesta (around 1920) and Andrew Russel (end of the 1920s).\n\nThis record contains some of the recordings made by these artists. The booklet contains 16 pages of detailed notes in both English and Swedish, as well as a rich treasure-chest of archive photos.
