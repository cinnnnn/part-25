She's not afraid to break the law a little, as long as it means helping someone she loves.\n \nBut her luck takes an incredibly bad turn when she and Blake go to a rave to celebrate Blake getting into college, and Blake meets a mysterious older man who kills her by slipping her an overdose of a date rape drug. What's even worse is that this man then attacks Holly and frames her for the crime! And because of Holly's less than lawful behavior in the past, the cops are convinced that she is responsible for her best friend's death.\n \nBut then one day, while she is getting transferred to juvenile hall, a breakout attempt happens to free another detainee, and Holly is forced to escape.\n \nNow on the loose, with the cops absolutely sure that she is guilty; Holly decides that she won't rest until she brings to justice the man who framed her, and who murdered her best friend.\n\n\n\nCast:\n\nJennifer Allanson ...
