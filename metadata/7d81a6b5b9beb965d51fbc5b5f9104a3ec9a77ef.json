Since its inception, the band's line-up has included Eddie Vedder (lead vocals, guitar), Jeff Ament (bass guitar), Stone Gossard (rhythm guitar), and Mike McCready (lead guitar). The band's current drummer is Matt Cameron, formerly of Soundgarden, who has been with the band since 1998.\nFormed after the demise of Ament and Gossard's previous band Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten. One of the key bands of the grunge movement in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam was criticized early onÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½most notably by Nirvana frontman Kurt CobainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as being a corporate cash-in on the alternative rock explosion. However, over the course of the band's career its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make music videos and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having &quot;spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.&quot;\nSince its inception, the band has sold over thirty million records in the U.S., and an estimated sixty million worldwide. Pearl Jam has outlasted many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade. Allmusic calls Pearl Jam &quot;the most popular American rock &amp; roll band of the '90s.&quot;\nCompared with the other grunge bands of the early 1990s, Pearl JamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s style is noticeably less heavy and harkens back to the classic rock music of the 1970s. Pearl Jam has cited many punk rock and classic rock bands as influences, including The Who, Neil Young, and the Ramones. Pearl JamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s success has been attributed to its sound, which fuses &quot;the riff-heavy stadium rock of the '70s with the grit and anger of '80s post-punk, without ever neglecting hooks and choruses.&quot; Gossard's rhythm guitar style is known for its sense of beat and groove, while McCready's lead guitar style, influenced by artists such as Jimi Hendrix, has been described as &quot;feel-oriented&quot; and &quot;rootsy.&quot;\nPearl Jam has broadened its musical range with subsequent releases. As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less catchy. He said, &quot;I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes.&quot; By 1994ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Vitalogy, the band began to incorporate more punk influences into its music. The bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 1996 album, No Code, was a deliberate break from the musical style of Ten. The songs on the album featured elements of garage rock, worldbeat, and experimentalism. After 1998ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Yield, which was somewhat of a return to the straightforward rock approach of the band's early work, the band dabbled with experimental art rock on 2000ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Binaural and folk rock elements on 2002ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Riot Act. The bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2006 album, Pearl Jam, was cited as a return to the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s early sound. The band's 2009 album, Backspacer, contains elements of pop and New Wave.\nCritic Jim DeRogatis describes Vedder's vocals as a &quot;Jim Morrison-like vocal growl.&quot; Greg Prato of Allmusic said, &quot;With his hard-hitting and often confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also became one of the most copied lead singers in all of rock.&quot; Vedder's lyrical topics range from personal (&quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Better Man&quot;) to social and political concerns (&quot;Even Flow&quot;, &quot;World Wide Suicide&quot;). His lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, individualism, and sympathy for troubled individuals. When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the Vitalogy era. McCready said in 2006, &quot;Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a power chord thing, and I fit into all that.&quot;\nWhile Nirvana had brought grunge to the mainstream in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam quickly outsold them, and became &quot;the most popular American rock &amp; roll band of the '90s&quot; according to Allmusic. Pearl Jam has been described as &quot;modern rock radio's most influential stylists ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the workmanlike midtempo chug of songs like &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Even Flow&quot; just melodic enough to get moshers singing along.&quot; The band inspired and influenced a number of bands, ranging from Silverchair to Puddle of Mudd and The Strokes. Pearl Jam has outlasted many of its contemporaries in the grunge scene like Nirvana and Soundgarden.\nPearl Jam has been praised for its rejection of rock star excess and its insistence on backing causes it believes in. Music critic Jim DeRogatis said in the aftermath of the band's battle with Ticketmaster that it &quot;proved that a rock band which isn't comprised of greed heads can play stadiums and not milk the audience for every last dime... it indicated that idealism in rock 'n' roll is not the sole province of those '60s bands enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.&quot; Eric Weisbard of Spin said in 2001, &quot;The group that was once accused of being synthetic grunge now seem as organic and principled a rock band as exists.&quot; In a 2005 USA Today reader's poll, Pearl Jam was voted the greatest American rock band of all time. In April 2006, Pearl Jam was awarded the prize for &quot;Best Live Act&quot; in Esquire's Esky Music Awards. The blurb called Pearl Jam &quot;the rare superstars who still play as though each show could be their last.&quot; Pearl Jam's fanbase following (often referred to as the &quot;Jamily&quot;) has been compared to that of the Grateful Dead's, with Rolling Stone magazine stating that Pearl Jam &quot;toured incessantly and became one of rock's great arena acts, attracting a fanatical, Grateful Dead-like cult following with marathon, true-believer shows in the vanishing spirit of Bruce Springsteen, the Who and U2.&quot; When asked about Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, &quot;I think at some point along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people something to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we needed something to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t always easy, but I think we found a way.&quot;\n\n\n\nBinaural\n\nBinaural is the sixth studio album by the American alternative rock band Pearl Jam, released on May 16, 2000 through Epic Records. Following a full-scale tour in support of its previous album, Yield (1998), Pearl Jam took a short break. The band then reconvened toward the end of 1999 and commenced work on a new album. The music on the record featured an experimental sound, evidenced on songs that utilized binaural recording techniques.\nBinaural debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. The album became the first Pearl Jam studio album to fail to reach platinum status. The album's 2000 tour spawned an enormous collection of official bootleg releases. The album has been certified gold by the RIAA in the United States.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d81a6b5b9beb965d51fbc5b5f9104a3ec9a77ef","amp;dn":"Pearl+Jam+-+Binaural+%282000%29+%5BLOSSLESS+FLAC%5D%5BTntvillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d81a6b5b9beb965d51fbc5b5f9104a3ec9a77ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,129,166,181,185,190,185,101,213,31,188,91,95,145,4,163,236,154,119,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
