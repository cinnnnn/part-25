We are limitless. We see all. And we do not forgive.\n\nWho defends the powerless against the GREEDY and the CORRUPT? Who protects the homeless and poverty-stricken from those who would PREY upon them in the DARK OF NIGHT?\n\nWhen those who are sworn to protect us abuse their power, when toxic government calls down super-human lackeys to force order upon the populace... finally, there is a force, a citizen's army, to push order BACK.\n\nLet those who abuse the system know this as well: We have our OWN super humans now. They are not afraid of your badges or Leagues. And they will not be SILENCED.\n\nWe are your neighbors. We are your co-workers. And we are your children.\n\nWritten by: Gail Simone\nArt by: Freddie E Williams II\nCover by: Amanda Conner\n\n32 Pages\nOn Sale: May 1, 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0efe2f8ff6d17eb78954136d439bbf2408220c28","amp;dn":"THE+MOVEMENT+001+%282013%29+%28THE+NEW+52%29+%28Digital%29+%28Nahga-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0efe2f8ff6d17eb78954136d439bbf2408220c28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,254,47,143,246,209,126,183,137,84,19,109,67,155,191,36,8,34,12,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
