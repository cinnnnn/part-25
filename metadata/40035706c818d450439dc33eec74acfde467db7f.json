Joeri Woudstra, who hails from the Netherlands. He released his debut, self-titled EP, on the Sonic Router imprint, on the 12th March 2012. 6 tracks long itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a deft exploration of mood that sets a torrent of found samples, ambient swirls and little wayward riffs to post-Dilla drum patterns. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hazy, crackly hangover music. A collection of tracks that manage to sound archaic before theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve even been mixed down, fusing WoudstraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique approach to production with a sense of isolation and introspection. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Torus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Torus&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40035706c818d450439dc33eec74acfde467db7f","amp;dn":"Torus+-+Torus+EP+%2B+Sonic+Router+Mix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40035706c818d450439dc33eec74acfde467db7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,3,87,6,200,24,212,80,67,157,195,62,236,116,172,253,228,103,219,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
