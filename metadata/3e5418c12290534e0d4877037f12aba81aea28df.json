They released three albums, none of which achieved much in terms of chart position. In 1989, their former keyboard player and co-lead vocalist Steve Hogarth joined Marillion as lead vocalist. The Europeans should not be confused with the similarly named Europeans, a Bristol band that were active 1977-1979, who released several recordings on Heartbeat Records and Bristol Archive Records.&quot;\n\nTRACK LIST:\nA1 The Animal Song 3:50\nA2 A.
