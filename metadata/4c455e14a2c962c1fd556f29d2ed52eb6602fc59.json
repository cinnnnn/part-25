After cutting several demos, the duo recruited bassist Jonathan &quot;J.B.&quot; Brightman and drummer Devon Glenn and began performing live, quickly earning a local following for their swaggering, grunge-flavored music. Following the subsequent addition of second guitarist Yogi, Buckcherry signed with DreamWorks Records and issued their self-titled debut LP in 1999. Singles such as &quot;Check Your Head&quot; and &quot;For the Movies&quot; were modern rock hits, allowing Buckcherry to raise their profile by summer 2000. \n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t100.00% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tCentury Media Records\nCatalogue:\t\t9007-2\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Gluttony\n02.Wrath\n03.Nothing Left But Tears\n04.The Truth\n05.Greed\n06.Water\n07.Seven Ways To Die\n08.Air\n09.Sloth\n10.Pride\n11.Envy\n12.Lust\n13.Dreamin' Of You\n14.Give 'Em What They Want (Bonus Track)\n15.When The Fire Starts (Bonus Track)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c455e14a2c962c1fd556f29d2ed52eb6602fc59","amp;dn":"Buckcherry+-+Confessions+%5BDeluxe+Ed.%5D+%282013%29+FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c455e14a2c962c1fd556f29d2ed52eb6602fc59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,69,94,20,162,201,98,193,253,85,111,41,210,237,82,235,102,2,252,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
