Fear not, this may be the one! Imagine cruising through wide-open expanses, top downÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ this soul-seeping stuff blasting. When I say soul-seeping, I mean it. With repeated listens, this stuff will seep into you and become such a part of you, that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll not be able to pinpoint exactly when/where you end and it begins. This low-tempo indietronica is fueled with just the right amount of Americana to give it a special indescribable quality that seems a perfect fit for a road-trip album. There is much to be found within this musicÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ deserts, canyons, mountains, forests, road-side attractions, road-side distractions and of course thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s endless tarmac. So when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re heading back from SXSW, be sure to take this along for the ride. It just may be the difference between a Griswold and a Hunter S. Thompson type of trip.\n\nMost importantly, thanks again for taking time out to visit blocSonic and give our releases a moment of your time!
