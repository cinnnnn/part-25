Of course, that episode isn't available due to Edmonds being a party-pooper.\nAlso, it seems that this episode is edited!  The TOTP2 performance database mentions a Pan's People performance of Typically Tropical's 'Barbados' and Hot Chocolate with 'You Sexy Thing', neither of whom appear.

The tracklisting is as follows :- (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“vÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ denotes video)\n\nAdam &amp; The Ants ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Antmusic\nShowaddywaddy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Blue Moon\nMadness ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Embarrassment\nStatus Quo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Lies\nMatchbox ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Over The Rainbow\nPolice ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ De Do Do Do De Da Da Da (v)\nQueen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Flash\nStray Cats ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Runaway Boys\nAbba ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Super Trouper (v)\nJohn Lennon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Imagine (live)\n\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s alot going on in this episode. This weeks obligatory interview segments are with Jermaine Jackson and a rather startled looking Gary Numan who claims heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s giving up music. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no Legs &amp; Co but there are three 1950s throwback acts which just proves the early 80s wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t all post punk and New Romantic at all. Finally, this is the first episode to be transmitted after the death of John Lennon and thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a rather nice tribute after the ending titles have finished when the programme comes back and a live performance of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ImagineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (not the usual video) is played.\n\nThis recording is NOT from a UK Gold repeat. It is somebodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s home recording of the time and I suspect that due to the special Beatles connection this has come a few generations down the line. The quality is ok but it isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t up to the usual standard, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a slight orange hue (see screenshots) it shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t spoil your enjoyment but do be aware of it.\n\nTechnical Info (from Gspot)\nDuration ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 38m 48s\nFile Size ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 323 MB\nCodec ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Xvid\nframe Size ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 640 x 480\nframe Rate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 25fps\nBitrate - 1018kbps\nAudio ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ MPEG 1 Layer 3\nFrequency ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 48000Hz\nBitrate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 135kb/s\nStereo\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nTop Of The Pops (18th December 1980) [VHS Rip (XviD)]\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe last Christmas Top of the Pops before the Christmas Top of the Pops...ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Simon Bates a bit confusedly in the penultimate TOTP of 1980.

There is a slight issue with crackly sound for the first minute or two but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s corrected itself by the end of The Nolans. This is an issue with the original satellite recording and not my encoding. \nAs with all Uk Gold repeats, programme may be edited from original transmission.\n\nTechnical Info (from Gspot)\nDuration ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 51m 19s\nFile Size ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 349MB\nCodec ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ XviD\nframe Size ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 640 x 480\nframe Rate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 25fps\nBitrate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 806 kbps\nAudio ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ MPEG 1 Layer 3\nFrequency ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 48000Hz\nBitrate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 132 kb/s\nStereo\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nTop Of The Pops Xmas Special (25th December 1981) [VHS Rip (XviD)]\n\nPresented by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Radio 1 D.JÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s (specifically Jimmy Saville, Kid Jensen, Tony Blackburn, John Peel, DLT, Adrian Juste, Simon Bates, Andy Peebles,Paul Burnett, Paul Gambaccini, Steve Wright, Peter Powell, Richard Skinner, Tommy Vance, Mike Reid)\n\nAn excellent show containing the following tracks (all are studio performances.

Firstly it contains John PeelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s return to the show after an apparantly disasterous attempt back in the 60s. Secondly UltravoxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ViennaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in which Midge Ure appears to be wearing bondage gear (see picture) and finally the truly jaw dropping interpretation of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“O SupermanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ by Zoo in which a high court judge dances around pulsating pods. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not making any of this up!\n\nThe quality of this episode, although excellent on tape pixellated quite badly when encoded. I re-encoded it at a higher bitrate (hence the slightly bigger file size than normal) and although perfectly watchable, you might find it slightly blockier than normal, for this I can only apologise. On the positive side itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s NOT a Uk Gold repeat which means it wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be edited in any way!\n\nTechnical Info (from Gspot)\nDuration ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 58m 46s\nFile Size ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 498MB\nCodec ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ XviD\nframe Size ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 640 x 480\nframe rate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 25fps\nBitrate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1040 kbps\nAudio ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ MPEG 1 Layer 3\nFrequency ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 48000Hz\nBitrate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 133kb/s\nStereo\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nTop Of the Pops-Christmas Day 1984 [VHSRip (XVID)]\n\nDescription\tAnother episode of TOTP ripped from a VHS my haording husband has kept all these years.Again the quality is as good as you'd expect from a tape of this vintage.\nOne other thing on the quality, this was a typical VHS recording so the  beginning and end are slightly abrupt, but none of the actual programme is lost.Also the sound is slightly muffled for about 45 seconds in the middle of the first song, after that it's fine.\nAll the acts are live in the studio except for Wham/George Michael.this includes virtually all the members of Band Aid.
