Stars\n\n\n&quot;Its been a long time coming but Clare BowditchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fourth studio album, Modern Day Addiction, is very much worth the wait.\n\nModern Day Addiction is a contagious, satirical, yet heart-achingly tender album about humanity and Ã¢â‚¬Å“the eternal search for meaningÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in a world of quick, delicious fixes. It stands as a companion on the journey for anyone whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever asked the question Ã¢â‚¬Å“Surely there must be more?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ followed by the statement Ã¢â‚¬Å“If so, great, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll pop back for it once IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve finished reading this article about absolute-rubbish-that-somehow-has-me-transfixed-to-the-screenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦everyone SHUT UP! IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m concentratingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAs Clare tells it (and who knows if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s telling the truth? Have you noticed how all her stories these days begin with Ã¢â‚¬Å“I woke up one morningÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½?)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I woke up one morning and my heart was broken (just in the usual, everyday way) and all I wanted was a muffin, and a tall glass of combined coffee and Jagermeister, even though I was neither hungry, nor thirsty, which prompted the thought Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hmm, how very interesting! Perhaps thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an album in here somewhere?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Thus began my extensive and exhaustive research-project into the topic of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everyday Addiction and the Human ConditionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Oh the reading list was endless, I tell you, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve barely left the local-newsagency sinceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn a most enjoyable and surprising way, Modern Day Addiction also aims to celebrate and question the modern world that produced it.&quot;\n\ncd ripped by X Lossless Decoder version 20100711 (120.5)\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/22/clare-bowditch/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/22/clare-bowditch/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a563fbb5c192b48374f429db402691d7e720c50c","amp;dn":"Clare+Bowditch+and+the+New+Slang...Modern+Day+Addiction%282012%29%5BFL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a563fbb5c192b48374f429db402691d7e720c50c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,99,251,181,193,146,180,131,116,244,41,219,64,38,145,215,231,32,197,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
