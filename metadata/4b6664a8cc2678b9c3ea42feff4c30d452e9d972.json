The group had one minor hit song in &quot;Wishbone&quot; which received some air time on MTV2 and Fuse and was featured in TV commercials. During the group's brief tenure, frontman John Kosco offered guest vocals to Godsmack's acoustic release, &quot;TouchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©,&quot; which found moderate success as well.\n\nAfter the demise of Dropbox, Kosco and Wilkinson formed a new group with bassist John &quot;Eville&quot; Freeman and drummer Chris Hamilton, formerly of Bloodsimple, called Saint Caine. Wilkinson left the band to dedicate all his time to his new project Piston Driven stating that being in Saint Caine left him feeling &quot;unfulfilled&quot;. Lee Richards went on to join his former Godsmack bandmates in Another Animal as a second guitarist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b6664a8cc2678b9c3ea42feff4c30d452e9d972","amp;dn":"Dropbox+-+%282004%29+Dropbox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b6664a8cc2678b9c3ea42feff4c30d452e9d972","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,102,100,168,204,38,120,185,195,234,66,254,255,76,48,212,82,233,217,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
