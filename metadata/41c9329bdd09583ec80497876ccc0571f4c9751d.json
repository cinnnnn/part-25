Also making a significant contribution is flautist Herbie Mann, who adds an airy texture to the standard jazz accompaniment.\n\nBaker is restrained and supportive of Pace&amp;#039;s Sinatra-like vocals, filling up the holes between phrases along with contributing some tasty solo spots. Pace&amp;#039;s rich voice is ideal for such classic ballads as &quot;Crazy, She Calls Me,&quot; &quot;This is Always,&quot; and &quot;Yesterdays,&quot; although Chet Baker fans may be anxious to hear the trumpeter sing a few lines of his own. Still, it&amp;#039;s good to hear Baker&amp;#039;s trumpet interleaved with a vocalist since his own vocal records usually gave us either one or the other. More spirited tracks such as the opening &quot;All or Nothing At All&quot; and &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; get a little schmaltzy, with a grooving counterbalance that propels the tunes to greater than the sum of their parts.
