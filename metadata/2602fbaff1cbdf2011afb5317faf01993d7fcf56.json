In this paper, I assume, without\nexamining the evidence, the veracity of the often-repeated argument that there is\nan increasing need for transnational and supranational institutions in the new\nglobal context; and consider, in that context, the type of democratic legitimacy\nthat might attach to such institutions.1 This latter focus represents a departure from some current cosmopolitan theorizing about such global institutions, which offer a justice-based account of their legitimacy, namely, global institutions are justified if they bring about a fairer world.2 I then attempt to sketch the sort of account that would be necessary to create democratic and accountable global institutions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2602fbaff1cbdf2011afb5317faf01993d7fcf56","amp;dn":"Globalization+and+Democratization%3A+Institutional+Design+for+Glob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2602fbaff1cbdf2011afb5317faf01993d7fcf56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,2,251,175,241,203,223,32,17,175,181,49,127,175,1,153,61,127,207,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
