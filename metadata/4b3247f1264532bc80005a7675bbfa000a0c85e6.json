(1986) and several tracks that would later appear on Zoot Allures (1976). One song, &quot;Kaiser Rolls&quot;, appears for the first time on FZ:OZ.\r\n\r\nThis particular band - with tenor saxophonist Napoleon Murphy Brock, bassist Roy Estrada, drummer Terry Bozzio, and keyboardist Andre Lewis (in his only tour with Zappa) - has only been represented sporadically on Zappa's earlier releases.\r\n\r\nZappa's guitar solos are of the usual high caliber, and his band is well rehearsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Zappa\r\n\r\nFZ:OZ\r\n\r\n(Hordern Pavilion, Sydney, Australia, January 20, 1976)\r\n\r\n2002\r\n\r\n\r\n2CDs / 2002 / VBR-V0\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack List:\r\n\r\nDisc 1:\r\n\r\n1.
