In a bar, he picks up Cheung Bik-yan (Isabella Leong), with a line that will come to haunt him: &quot;You remind me of my first girlfriend.&quot;\n\nTaciturn, and with the look of a drifter, Cheung remains enigmatic. But some time after they&amp;#039;ve slept together, she floors Ma with the news that she&amp;#039;s his daughter.\n\nCheung says all she wants is a little money to pay her back rent and rescue her dog, Isabella, who&amp;#039;s been locked in the apartment by her landlord. By default, the pair spend a lot of time together, wandering around the picturesque Macau streets and lounging in Ma&amp;#039;s tatty apartment -- all of which is set to a repetitive, largely Latin-flavored score.\n\nMore often seen in comic or offbeat roles, To is fine as the cop whose life took the wrong track almost from the start. Newcomer Wong, who debuted in &quot;The Eye: Infinity,&quot; and recalls a wilder-looking version of actress Cecilia Cheung, is also believable as the waifish, leggy Cheung. Shame neither of them has much of a script to chew on, as they stroll through Man Lim-chung&amp;#039;s atmospheric production design and d.p. Charlie Lam&amp;#039;s gently pastel lensing.\n\nIn an apparent effort to beef up the pic, Anthony Wong cameos as Ma&amp;#039;s colorful friend, and other names (Shawn Yue, Josie Ho) clock in briefly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07353616820dc9d0308f566da9dfc6eb59eeee77","amp;dn":"Isabella","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07353616820dc9d0308f566da9dfc6eb59eeee77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,53,54,22,130,13,201,208,48,143,86,109,169,223,198,235,89,238,238,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
