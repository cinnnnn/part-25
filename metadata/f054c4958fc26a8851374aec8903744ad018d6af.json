She never wanted for anything, except love-unconditional love from her parents. Love was a foreign emotion, and watching her parents love/hate relationship was never easy. So when it came to her personal life, she made sure she never had to relive that. With looks that could kill, it was simple for Chyna to be the love 'em and leave 'em kind of girl. And she had always been okay with it. She would rather be single the rest of her life then end up as miserable as her parents. So when a man rescued her after she was drugged in a night club, she never expected to start a relationship with him. But one chance meeting changes it all. Chyna is offered a once in a lifetime opportunity that could sky rocket her career, and she is forced to make a decision that could ruin everything.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f054c4958fc26a8851374aec8903744ad018d6af","amp;dn":"Linde_K_A_-Avoiding_Intimacy.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f054c4958fc26a8851374aec8903744ad018d6af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,84,196,149,143,194,106,136,81,55,74,236,137,3,116,74,208,24,214,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
