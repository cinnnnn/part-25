Connect your device to the computer.\n\n2. Go into the Garmin folder on the device and backup the file named gmapprom.img to your computer.\n\n3. Delete the gmapprom.imgÃ‚ï¿½ file from the GPS.\n\n4. Copy the unlocked gmapsupp.imgÃ‚ï¿½ file from this torrent into the Garmin folder on the device.\n\n5. Restart your device and check your map info via : Tools&gt;Settings&gt;Map&gt;Map Info.\n\nIf you have any problems using gmapsupp.img, try renaming it to gmapprom.img. I use a Nuvi 750 and haven't had any problems with it being named gmapsupp.img.\n\nAlso, this file will work from a SD card just as it is. Copy it to your SD card, put the card back into your GPS and follow step 5 above.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb2ca79b39e4e6b75aeacfa12c55db319c66a70d","amp;dn":"Garmin+City+Navigator+North+America+NT+2013.10+unlocked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb2ca79b39e4e6b75aeacfa12c55db319c66a70d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,44,167,155,57,228,230,183,90,234,207,161,44,85,219,49,156,102,167,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
