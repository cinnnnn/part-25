Ã¢â‚¬Å“Most people see things worse than they are so they never have to try,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Robbins. Ã¢â‚¬Å“People say to me Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m scepticalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and I say no youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re gutless.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nRobbins has been the personal coach to a raft of celebrities including Mikhail Gorbachev and Bill Clinton. At last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wimbledon, Serena Williams, another Robbins follower, was spotted with her own self-help notes: Ã¢â‚¬Å“My good thoughts are powerful. Any negative thoughts are weak. You are number one. You are the best. You will win Wimbledon.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“But letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s face it, none of us are going to win Wimbledon,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Yentob. Ã¢â‚¬Å“And anyway, we keep being told itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not all about winning, so why do we need these books?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“I think we all have pain,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Amy Jenkins, writer of This Life and a self-help fan. \n\n\nDavid Burns, a pioneer of cognitive therapy, challenges pain head on with the idea that Ã¢â‚¬Å“your thoughts create your feelings, so your thoughts can change your feelings.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This is not just a fad; his self-help book on cognitive therapy is now prescribed by doctors around the world instead of antidepressants. \n\n\nYentobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s optimism is bought crushingly down to earth by the Freudian psychoanalyst Adam Philips. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Freud said the purpose of psychoanalysis is to turn neurotic misery into everyday unhappiness, and what he meant by that is that people arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to be transformed magically.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\n\nIn search of the roots of the self-help genre, Yentob discovers Self Help by Samuel Smiles, which was published in 1859, the same year as DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Origin of Species. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Guess which one was the bestseller?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The next blockbuster was How to Win Friends And Influence People by Dale Carnegie, published in 1936, during the Depression. \n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Now we live in a culture of constant change and turnover,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says the self-help critic Micki McGee. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You not only have to be employed, but constantly employable. Not only married, but constantly marriageable. And that is the moment self-help emerges as a powerful literature.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nThe episode ends with The Wizard of Oz, the ultimate self-help film. All the characters - the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, the Lion and Dorothy - think they have to look to the Wizard for the answers; what they eventually realise is they were within themselves all along. \n\n\nSo has Yentob been changed by his voyage of discovery? Ã¢â‚¬Å“The truth is there is more to self-help than I thought,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he admits.\n\n\nThe Secret of Life, BBC ONE, Tuesday 19th February 2008\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64c8851bdf56ca940a32748cc4afa91f925a54af","amp;dn":"NapolEON+HILL.+poweriso+program+for+audiobooks+iso+open","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64c8851bdf56ca940a32748cc4afa91f925a54af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,200,133,27,223,86,202,148,10,50,116,140,196,175,169,31,146,90,84,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
