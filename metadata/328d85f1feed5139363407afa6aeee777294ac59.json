The topics include physics at accelerators and studies of Standard Model and Beyond, neutrino and astroparticle physics, cosmology, CP Violation and rare decays, hadron physics, and new developments in quantum field theory. The papers of the volume reveal the present status and new development in the above mentioned items. In particular, the first results on measurement of LHC pp collision events are also reported.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 472 pages\n    * Publisher: World Scientific Publishing Company (October 10, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 9814329673\n    * ISBN-13: 978-9814329675","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:328d85f1feed5139363407afa6aeee777294ac59","amp;dn":"Particle+Physics+at+the+Year+of+Astronomy%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"328d85f1feed5139363407afa6aeee777294ac59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,141,133,241,254,237,81,57,54,52,7,175,166,174,238,119,114,148,172,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
