The band plays a personally composed Ã¢â‚¬ËœFreedom RockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that swings hard with an energetic, authoritarian and uncompromising sound. (amazon.com)\n\nFree Fall seem to have made the perfect start with this album. The four-piece, one-guitar lineup is the ultimate epitome of a classic heavy rock band, and with this exact type of lineup, Free Fall do things in the right earnest. For fans of classic hard rock, Free FallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœPower &amp; VolumeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is an absolute must. A fantastic debut without a doubt!\n\n- - -\n\nFree Fall - Power and Volume 2013\n(Nuclear Blast)\n\n     1. Power &amp; Volume\n     2. Free Fall\n     3. Midnight Vulture\n     4.
