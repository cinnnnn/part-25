The result was a disc evenly divided between Mason's catchy folk-rock compositions and Steve Winwood's compelling rock jams. Mason's material was the most appealing both initially and eventually: the lead-off track, a jaunty effort called &quot;You Can All Join In,&quot; became a European hit, and &quot;Feelin' Alright?&quot; turned out to be the only real standard to emerge from the album after it started earning cover versions from Joe Cocker and others in the 1970s. Winwood's efforts, with their haunting keyboard-based melodies augmented by Chris Wood's reed work and Jim Capaldi's exotic rhythms, work better as musical efforts than lyrical ones. Primary lyricist Capaldi's words tend to be impressionistic reveries or vague psychological reflections; the most satisfying is the shaggy-dog story &quot;Forty Thousand Headmen,&quot; which doesn't really make any sense as anything other than a dream. But the lyrics to Winwood/Capaldi compositions take a back seat to the playing and Winwood's soulful voice. As Mason's simpler, more direct performances alternate with the more complex Winwood tunes, the album is well-balanced. It's too bad that the musicians were not able to maintain that balance in person; for the second time in two albums, Mason found himself dismissed from the group just as an LP to which he'd made a major contribution hit the stores. Only a few months after that, the band itself split up, but not before scoring their second consecutive Top Ten ranking in the U.K.; the album also reached the Top 20 in the U.S., breaking the temporarily defunct group stateside.\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAll Music Top Pick\n\n\nMFSL version published in 1995.\n\nTracklisting-\n1- You Can All Join In (3:36)\n2- Pearly Queen (4:18)\n3- Don't Be Sad (3:21)\n4- Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring (3:12)\n5- Feelin' Alright?
