Now considered a classic of English literature, Wuthering Heights met with mixed reviews by critics when it first appeared, with many horrified by the stark depictions of mental and physical cruelty. Though Charlotte BrontÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Jane Eyre was originally considered the best of the BrontÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« sistersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ works, many subsequent critics of Wuthering Heights argued that its originality and achievement made it superior.
