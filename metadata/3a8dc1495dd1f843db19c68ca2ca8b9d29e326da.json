But times have changed. The world has changed. And now the Chocolate Mountains are the home of the largest military artillery range in the world.\n\nHarry?s living on disability and getting liquored up and beaten down. Frank?s a feisty old-timer battling cancer and a domineering daughter. And Ricky?s a good kid in a bad spot, doing everything for family. Together they?re staking what little they have left on a dangerous quest to the Big Maria Mine? and the gold that can offer them a new beginning.\n\nUnfortunately a meth-dealing biker wants a piece, a trigger-happy AWOL soldier wants to play chicken in a live minefield, two stubborn burros want to go home, a starving mountain lion wants his dinner, and the US Army wants to rain on our heroes? parade with real bombs.\nWhen you?re all out of crazy ideas, you?ve got to try the stupid ones.\n\nGenre: Mystery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a8dc1495dd1f843db19c68ca2ca8b9d29e326da","amp;dn":"Big+Maria+by+Johnny+Shaw","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a8dc1495dd1f843db19c68ca2ca8b9d29e326da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,141,193,73,93,209,248,67,219,25,198,140,162,202,139,157,41,227,38,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
