(aka Where Have All The New Gods Gone?) is a story arc (published in October Ã¢â‚¬â€œ December, 1980) from three consecutive issues (numbers 183, 184 and 185) of the Justice League Of America comic book.\n\nOn their way to their annual joint meeting, being held simultaneously on Earth-1 and Earth-2, several members of the Justice League and Justice Society are abducted via the Transmatter Cubes, and transported to New Genesis, home of The New Gods.  The New Gods are seeking the Super-heroesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ aid after the remaining populace of New Genesis was kidnapped and enslaved by the minions of Apokolips (the evil world that is New Genesis' counterpart) and they reveal that Apokolips' new allies are the members of Earth-2Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Injustice Society.  The heroes split up into teams, each team comprised of one JLA member, one JSA member, and one New God.  The teams speed to various locales to undo the Apokolipsians' evil, only to discover that their ultimate plan is the resurrection of their late leader, Darkseid.\n\nThis torrent was created upon request.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d70235e535066f878d2ec517021d53a25187c6ba","amp;dn":"Crisis+On+New+Genesis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d70235e535066f878d2ec517021d53a25187c6ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,2,53,229,53,6,111,135,141,46,197,23,2,29,83,162,81,135,198,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
