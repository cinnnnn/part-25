I took all the PDF&amp;#039;s, converted them to JPG&amp;#039;s and packed them into CBZ&amp;#039;s so they could be read by the various comic viewers out there (CDDisplay, ComicRack, etc.) I also broke it up by the decades so it would be easier to download than the original 5 gig download.\n\nAll credit for this goes to the original uploader and/or scanner. I just did the conversion from PDF to JPG and packed them. Of course I did this over 450 times. :)\n\n\n******\n\nBy request, this torrent was broken down even further by each year of the 80&amp;#039;s decade.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:241fd136a64a991e9e18f04b440e73e4eef8af4a","amp;dn":"A+Decade+of+the+X-Men+-+The+80%5C%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"241fd136a64a991e9e18f04b440e73e4eef8af4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,31,209,54,166,74,153,30,158,24,240,75,68,14,115,228,238,248,175,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
