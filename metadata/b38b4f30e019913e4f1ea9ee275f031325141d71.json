B. Tauris | 2007 | ISBN 1845111664 | PDF | 400 pages\n\nThis fresh and original interpretation of one of the twentieth century's most extraordinary personalities shows for the first time how Gandhi's religious beliefs, political career and personal behavior form a coherent whole. Tidrick revealingly examines Gandhi's ideas about the relationship between sexual control and power, and the bizarre and scandalous behavior that resulted, and explores his interest in new religious and philosophical thinking. Drawing on material neglected by earlier biographers, the portrait which emerges does not show the secular saint of popular myth but a difficult and self-obsessed man driven to pursue the world-changing destiny he believed was marked out for him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b38b4f30e019913e4f1ea9ee275f031325141d71","amp;dn":"Gandhi+-+A+Political+and+Spiritual+Life+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b38b4f30e019913e4f1ea9ee275f031325141d71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,139,79,48,224,25,145,62,79,30,169,238,39,95,3,19,37,20,29,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
