In fact, she disappeared to escape from her sadistic husband, Glenn. When dismembered body parts were found near their home, Glenn was convicted of his wife's murder. And Megan, terrified for her unborn child's safety, never came forward with the truth. . .\n\nIs More Terrifying\n\nSince then, Megan has built a new life in Seattle for herself and her son, Josh. She's never forgotten that she's a fugitive, and Josh knows nothing about her past. But someone does. First, there are anonymous emails and threats, just as she learns that Glenn has been released from prison. Then the unthinkable happens: a masked man breaks into their home and abducts Josh. . .\n\nThan Fiction\n\nTo save her son, Megan must put herself at the mercy of a maniac. Is Glenn a cold-blooded killer determined to destroy her world piece by piece, or is the truth even more twisted? Megan thought she knew fear, but her nightmare is only beginning. . .\n\nPraise for the Novels of Kevin O'Brien\n\n&quot;White knuckle action! . . .takes readers into the darkest corners of the human mind.&quot; --Tess Gerritsen on One Last Scream\n\n&quot;Scary!
