There are four people from his past who he thinks could be responsible--and Strike knows that any one of them is capable of sustained and unspeakable brutality.\r\n\r\nWith the police focusing on the one suspect Strike is increasingly sure is not the perpetrator, he and Robin take matters into their own hands, and delve into the dark and twisted worlds of the other three men. But as more horrendous acts occur, time is running out for the two of them...\r\n\r\nCareer of Evil is the third in the highly acclaimed series featuring private detective Cormoran Strike and his assistant Robin Ellacott. A fiendishly clever mystery with unexpected twists around every corner, it is also a gripping story of a man and a woman at a crossroads in their personal and professional lives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36704f5d88eff26ae0106dc592409ce43bb6d838","amp;dn":"Career+of+Evil+audiobook+by+Robert+Galbraith+EarReaders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36704f5d88eff26ae0106dc592409ce43bb6d838","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,112,79,93,136,239,242,106,224,16,109,197,146,64,156,228,59,182,216,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
