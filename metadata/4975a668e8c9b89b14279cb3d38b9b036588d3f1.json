Whether she is writing about hitch-hiking across Haiti to help out with disaster relief or living on a houseboat in Philadelphia in the winter, Kelli DunhamÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs humorous interpretation of difficult situations is both inspiring and entertaining.\n\nIn the tradition of authors such as David Sedaris and Ellen DeGeneres, DunhamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“slice of lifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ stories remind us that even though humans are deeply flawed, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also seriously hysterical that way.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nKelli Dunham is an award-winning stand up comic who has appeared on both Showtime and the Discovery Channel and tours nationally to colleges, comedy clubs, LGBT pride events and even the occasional livestock auction. Her comedy CDs Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am NOT a 12 Year Old BoyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Almost PrettyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why Is the Fat One Always AngryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are in regular rotation on Sirius/XM radioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rawdog Comedy as well as PandoraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Margaret Cho station. An ex-nun, and a current registered nurse, DunhamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous titles have included How to Survive and Maybe Even Love Nursing School (FA Davis, 2005) and How to Survive and Maybe Even Love Your Life as a Nurse (FA Davis, 2006) and have sold over 100,000 copies. Kelli is the author of two childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s books being used by Sonlight conservative home schooling association in their science curriculum.\n\nKelli was one of Velvet Park MagazineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 25 Significant Queer Women of 2011 and was named to the 2012 Campus Pride Hotlist. Kelli was also given the The Fresh Fruit Festival Award for Distinction in stand-up comedy, although Kelli has never before or since been called distinguished.\n\nKelli was recently the expert on Ã¢â‚¬Å“What Is NormalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Twist Magazine (known as Tiger BeatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little sister magazine), on a page facing a full color poster of Justin Beiber. There isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even a ironic statement to match that, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just strangely true.\n\nFIND OUT MORE ABOUT TOPSIDE PRESS AT: http://www.topsidepress.com\n\nSupport indie publishing by seeding this torrent, sharing reviews of this book online, and buying books at http://store.topsidepress.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4975a668e8c9b89b14279cb3d38b9b036588d3f1","amp;dn":"Freak+of+Nurture+-+Essays+and+Stories+by+Kelli+Dunham+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4975a668e8c9b89b14279cb3d38b9b036588d3f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,117,166,104,232,201,184,155,20,39,156,179,211,139,155,3,101,136,211,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
