John Petrucci offers detailed lessons on speed and accuracy, chromatic exercises, playing with dynamics, connecting scale fragments to form long solo lines and much, much more. One of the most complete courses on rock guitar.\n\n\n\nThis instructional media is an awesome one. Starting with physical exercises that would make you comfortable while playing for hours, and it even touches on several church modes. Even if you're just looking for playing backing, vamps, rhythms, and etc, this media will teach you about chord formations and theories which will add your piece of art more colors. However, I wouldn't recommend it for NOT serious players, because one would need ample amount of time/effort to accomplish Petrucci's lessons. Otherwise, a fabulous book every guitarists must have.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65b1fe41ba0397e69548c5e1c77fd1bbfcee3981","amp;dn":"John+Petrucci+-+Rock+Discipline","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65b1fe41ba0397e69548c5e1c77fd1bbfcee3981","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,177,254,65,186,3,151,230,149,72,197,225,199,127,209,187,252,238,57,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
