I got this book for a long plane trip, not knowing what I was getting into. I just couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t put it down. I finished the book 6 hours later. After landing, I looked for other thrillers from the author and couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find any. I believe this is his first and hopefully not the last. The book needs good reviews to entice the writer to write the sequel.\n\nSummary: Two American rangers, back from two tours in Afghanistan, travel to Acapulco to decompress before starting college.  However, Acapulco is being swept by two tropical storms bringing non-stop torrential rains. While clubbing, they have a disagreement with a cocky Mexican. Words and fists flyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and a new friendship is forged in combat. \n\nThe new friends are put to the test when they cross paths with a drug lord who is also in the human trafficking business. The three men have a very rare genetic mutation of Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Extreme Warrior GeneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which makes them natural protectors and kindred spirits, willing to use extreme violence when under attack. Their warrior instinct leads them on a hunt from Acapulco to Mexico City and on to Washington DC where they uncover a dark side to Washington politics.\n\nA word to the wise, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t start reading this book unless you can take the day-off. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be able to put it down.\n\nEnjoy this E-Book in epub, mobi and pdf formats","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf14e461a239fc6fc0fbd68bf245c402a202cd23","amp;dn":"Warriors+in+Paradise","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf14e461a239fc6fc0fbd68bf245c402a202cd23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,20,228,97,162,57,252,111,192,251,214,139,242,69,196,2,162,2,205,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
