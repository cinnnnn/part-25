She had produced an album of music that was compared to the works of Joni Mitchell, Rickie Lee Jones and Kate Bush. An interview with Rosie is available at http://www.granatino.com/sdresource/24rosie.htm\n\nBut she has a completed second album named &quot;Sun Across the Altar&quot; which had been put down by her label and still resides in the archives since 1991. Guitarist Rick Derringer (who played on both of Rosie's albums) is quoted as saying that Rosie's second album &quot;is excellent... the music, lyrics, songs, and singing exceed the quality of Zazu&quot;. You can read the whole story at http://www.zazu.jimfarmermusic.com/zazumuse.html\n\nIt is still possible to let the album be released by Cherry Red.\nSign the petition at http://www.thepetitionsite.com/869/025/614/release-rosie-velas-second-album-sun-across-the-altar and get at last to hear Rosie's second album!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cba2ad60ae2d7da39d807d39d7d2c57639129345","amp;dn":"Rosie+Vela+-+Zazu+%281986%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cba2ad60ae2d7da39d807d39d7d2c57639129345","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,162,173,96,174,45,125,163,157,128,125,57,215,210,197,118,57,18,147,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
