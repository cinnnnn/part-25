It draws on a range of empirical research and case studies to explore the meaning attached to land in contested places, the challenges these present to planners and the possibilities for accommodating differences over the use and development of territory. The author argues that planners have a significant role in the management of these processes and sets out some ideas about how this might be addressed in local and global settings, including the Balkans and Palestine.\n\nReview\n...a good introduction to the topic of planning in a divided society.\n-Choice\n\nAbout the Author\nBrendan Murtagh is a Reader in the School of Environmental Planning at the Queen's University of Belfast.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45488c2155a18e3f8cc33aa75efbfa9160a8977d","amp;dn":"Brendan+Murtagh+-+The+Politics+of+Territory+Policy+and+Segregati","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45488c2155a18e3f8cc33aa75efbfa9160a8977d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,72,140,33,85,161,142,63,140,195,58,167,94,251,250,145,96,168,151,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
