The film was all about the emotions. Marlon Brando in great form.  The tagline was &quot;and lightning hits the screen&quot;. For once I agree.\n\nIMDB:\nVal Xavier (Marlon Brando), a drifter of obscure origins arrives at a small town and gets a job in a store run by Lady Torrence (Anna Magnani), a sex-starved woman whose husband Jabe M. Torrance (Victor Jory) is dying of cancer upstairs. Val is pursued by Carol Cutere (Joanne Woodward), the enigmatic local tramp-of-good-family, who covets his snakeskin jacket as much as his body and tries to seduce him in the cemetery. Val is more attracted to the mature Lady and gets her pregnant.
