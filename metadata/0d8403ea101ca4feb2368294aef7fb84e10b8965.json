Next, in order to re-use this code in all future projects, we'll extract it to a Composer package. Along the way, we'll write some tests with PHPSpec, push our code to GitHub, and connect our code to Packagist.\n\nYou may now install this package through Composer. To do so, review the source and documentation on GitHub.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d8403ea101ca4feb2368294aef7fb84e10b8965","amp;dn":"Laracasts+-+Mar.+24+-+Extracting+Packages","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d8403ea101ca4feb2368294aef7fb84e10b8965","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,132,3,234,16,28,164,254,178,54,130,148,174,247,251,132,225,11,137,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
