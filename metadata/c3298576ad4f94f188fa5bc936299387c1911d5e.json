The initial order was for eight 30-minute episodes. The episode length later expanded to 60 minutes. TLC general manager Amy Winter said, &quot;We wanted to show there was diversity even within the Muslim community. These are families that might have beliefs that are different than yours, but we are all living similar daily lives and hopefully we will bring that to light.&quot;\n\nBefore deciding on Dearborn, TLC considered Muslim communities in San Diego, Washington and Northern Virginia.\n\n- Paraphrased from Wikipedia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3298576ad4f94f188fa5bc936299387c1911d5e","amp;dn":"All+American+Muslim+%5B2011+TLC%5D+Complete+Series+%288+Episodes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3298576ad4f94f188fa5bc936299387c1911d5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,41,133,118,173,79,148,241,136,250,91,201,54,41,147,135,193,145,29,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
