This is a film dedicated to any poor lad of the last thirty years who was unlucky enough to be that one miserable kid on the block without a video game console.  Or any Nintendo-loving child who suffered through the divorce of their parents by being tossed back-and-forth between their two separate residences like an old, stinky Nerf football that the dog chewed onÃ¢â‚¬Â¦while their Nintendo console kept up its merrily oblivious song of Pikachuvian bliss.\n\nBut yet, from the point-of-view of the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s functional-alcoholic father character, this movie is a riff on CamusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ famous dictum: the only real philosophical problem is whether or not to commit suicide.  Once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve decided that particular issue, the rest of lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s answers are, by comparison, simple.  The father just isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite up to making a firm decision on the suicide question.  Perhaps his Nintendo-loving son can assist him in making the wrong suicide choice for the right reasons?  Or is it the other way around?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39a37c9a80b7c556bf8fa8ab4aeff91e1e9add72","amp;dn":"Tristan+Newcomb+-+Summer+of+the+Chew+Toy+Soul+%282011%29+%28XVID%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39a37c9a80b7c556bf8fa8ab4aeff91e1e9add72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,163,124,154,128,183,197,86,191,143,168,171,74,239,249,30,30,154,221,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
