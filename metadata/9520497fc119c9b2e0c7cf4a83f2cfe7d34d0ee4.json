The player plays as if they are the president or prime minister of a democratic government. The player must introduce and alter policies in seven areas - tax, economy, welfare, foreign policy, transport, law and order and public services. Each policy has an effect on the happiness of various voter groups, as well as affecting factors such as crime and air quality. The player has to deal with &quot;situations&quot;, which are typically problems such as petrol protests or homelessness, and also has to make decisions on dilemmas that arise each turn.\n[...]\nDemocracy 2, like the first game, is also used by a number of schools, colleges and universities to teach political systems and economics. Positech Games sells reduced cost 'educational site licenses' to schools to encourage this usage of the game.[5] Positech Games has several times expressed a desire to get the game into as many schools as possible, but has only met with indifference in attempts to do so in the UK. The game is also used by a number of other establishments, such as company training seminars. It was also considered for use in political simulation by the US Department of Defense.&quot;\n- Wikipedia\n\nNice political game, shows the inner mechanics of a democratic state. Not only a near simulation, but also a strategy game as you have to plan your reforms ahead as your power is limited by the democratic institutions (unless you make a dictatorship :D ).\n\nTorrent by JR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9520497fc119c9b2e0c7cf4a83f2cfe7d34d0ee4","amp;dn":"Democracy+2+CE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9520497fc119c9b2e0c7cf4a83f2cfe7d34d0ee4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,32,73,127,193,25,201,178,224,199,207,74,131,242,207,231,211,77,14,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
