He speaks about the schism between Asiatic thought and European thought in terms of one constantly seeking out its lost kernel of wisdom in the Other (guess which one) and its counterpart just not giving a damn what the Other knows or desires. This leads us down an unforseen path in which Zizek, shockingly as is his style, denies to Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell their badge of honor as (true) fundamentalists and even makes an appeal for fundamentalism!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nFile format: m4a\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.slought.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.slought.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ec5f98783d3f725c65b8d71046f6525291a7166","amp;dn":"Slavoj+Zizek+-+Lecture+-+Appeal+to...+Fundamentalism%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ec5f98783d3f725c65b8d71046f6525291a7166","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,197,249,135,131,211,247,37,198,91,141,113,4,111,101,37,41,26,113,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
