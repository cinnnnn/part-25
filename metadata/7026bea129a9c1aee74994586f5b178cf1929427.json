Late one night, Edward Crane, 76, is declared dead at a London hospital. An obituary describes him only as a 'resourceful career diplomat'. But Crane was much more than that Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the circumstances surrounding his death are far from what they seem.\n\nFifteen years later, academic Sam Gaddis needs money. When a journalist friend asks for his help researching a sixth member of the notorious Trinity spy ring, Gaddis knows that she's onto a story that could turn his fortunes around. But within hours the journalist is dead, apparently from a heart attack.\n\nTaking over her investigation, Gaddis trails a man who claims to know the truth about Edward Crane.
