TRUST ME.\n\nThe story (based on a true story) revloves around several small time bumbling career criminals (Peter Faulk their leader) in Boston who decide to rob Brinks Security.  At the time Brinks held the payrolls for many of the largest companies in Massachusetts.  I am originally from about 20 min west of Boston, so this movie was special in that way too.  But even fans of the Evil Empire will love this Crime Comedy Caper.  Very funny, but also quite vilent at times; The Brinks Job&quot; is just an all around great American movie.  I found myself smiling the whole way through, and thoroughly enjoying every minute of it.  Oh and did I mention that only $50,000 of over 1 million dollars has ever been recovered (and that was the 50,000 in new bills that they flushed down the toilet).  I won&amp;#039;t tell you anything else as not to spoil it, but trust me you will like this movie.  Too bad it&amp;#039;s only on DVD in Japan, but i was lucky enough to be able to rent it fromNicheflix while it was still availible.\n\n\n\nLanguage    English\nSubtitles    Unknown if subtitles included\n\nSource    dvdrip\nRip Specs    File Name .............: The Brinks Job (1978) William Freidkin WS DVDRip.BS.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 734,175,232 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 1:43:08 (148356 frames)\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD 1.0.1\nFrame Size ............: 592x320\nFPS ...................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate .........: 809 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.178 bpp\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 127 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR audio\nInterleave ............: 42 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8ed71a29e246657601a5ed61e49617eb0c1a7aa","amp;dn":"Brinks+Job%2C+The+%281978%29+William+Freidkin+WS+DVDRip.BS%5BREPOST%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8ed71a29e246657601a5ed61e49617eb0c1a7aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,237,113,162,158,36,102,87,96,26,94,214,30,73,97,126,176,193,167,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
