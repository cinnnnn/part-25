It is widely regarded as one of their best albums. Rubycon further develops the Berlin School sequencer-based sound they ushered in with the title track from Phaedra.\n\nAlthough not quite matching the sales figures for Phaedra, Rubycon did give the group their highest ever UK chart placing. This was widely stated to be No.12, in a 14-week run. All editions of the now defunct Guinness Book of British Hit Albums gave this peak position, and for many years Tangerine Dream even headed the list of most charting albums (16 in all), without ever reaching the Top 10, before being overtaken by Irish duo Foster and Allen. However, a recent website (www.chartstats.com) clearly states that Rubycon did in fact peak at No.10.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e876d415b55324a57b29ebe840c3a68981d334e","amp;dn":"Tangerine+Dream+-+Rubycon+%281988%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e876d415b55324a57b29ebe840c3a68981d334e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,135,109,65,91,85,50,74,87,178,158,190,132,12,58,104,152,29,51,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
