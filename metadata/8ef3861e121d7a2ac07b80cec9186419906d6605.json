There's two and a half hours of music here on this 1979 4 CD set, performed by the Philip Glass Ensemble with Michael Riesman conducting.\nThis is fine music. Better than Glassworks in my opinion.\n\nFormat is 256k VBR AAC. The names of the songs are shortened to, for example, 'Act 3/2: Dance 2' as opposed to 'Glass: Einstein on the Beach: Act 3, Scene 2: Dance 2'.\n\nEnjoy! If you like classical and new classical music then check out my channel. Lotsa good stuff there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ef3861e121d7a2ac07b80cec9186419906d6605","amp;dn":"Glass%2C+Philip+%281937%29+-+Einstein+on+the+Beach+%28AAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ef3861e121d7a2ac07b80cec9186419906d6605","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,243,134,30,18,29,122,42,192,123,128,206,201,24,100,25,144,109,102,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
