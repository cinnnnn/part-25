Stirling Herrick wants it because his father did; and the Lynx himself seems determined to find it if only to exact some kind of revenge.\n\nCaught up in a violent world where life is held cheaply, Nora is both intoxicated by the gold rush climate and overwhelmed by the power of the mighty Lynx. \n\nUnable to desist, she becomes involved in his murderous schemes, returning to England, and to Whiteladies House","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aa8c657244589c6067916aafb39e4f1d8f1ba60","amp;dn":"The+Shadow+of+the+Lynx+%28Romance%29+-+Victoria+Holt+AZW3+EPUB+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aa8c657244589c6067916aafb39e4f1d8f1ba60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,168,198,87,36,69,137,198,6,121,22,170,251,57,228,241,216,241,186,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
