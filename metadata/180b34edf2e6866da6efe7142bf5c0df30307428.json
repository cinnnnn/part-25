Previously, these were displaying as corrupted data, when debranded, with FMCB 1.7. FMCB 1.8 is much more flexible and the graphics were changed in the installer and in the launcher2.elf file, for your convince. The Original PS2 Startup Logo has been restored, you can disable this by using a custom .CNF file during the install. \n\nThese ICONS are not game files they are application files, and they should not be showing there in the browser in the first place. Needless to say, I've tried something completely different with the apps in this release. Enjoy!!! I don't know that much about asm, but the people who have supported this release, wish to remain anonymous, Thank You for your Comments and Insights.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:180b34edf2e6866da6efe7142bf5c0df30307428","amp;dn":"Debranded+FMCB+1.8c+%2B+Plus+OPL+0.91+%2B+8+%2B+Invisible+Icon+and+Mor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"180b34edf2e6866da6efe7142bf5c0df30307428","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,11,52,237,242,230,134,109,166,239,231,20,43,245,192,223,48,48,116,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
