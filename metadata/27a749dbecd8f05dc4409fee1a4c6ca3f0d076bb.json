And it is often witnessed that the majority of the remakes of the classics and the blockbusters have turned successful at the box office. Nonetheless there are notions which go against the remakes. The question is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ if the remakes do well and get popular among the audiences and most importantly if they try to be different or slightly different injecting the dose of contemporary elements, then there is no harm at all to churn out them for the entertainment of the movie lovers who always seek something catchy and worthwhile to watch.\n\nOften the stars, who are roped into the remakes, are found saying that there is no comparison with the original character. Well, to some extent or as far as their acting is concerned, their claim seems to be okay. But the fact remains that you cannot change the audiencesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ minds who have already watched the original brand. So when they hit the theaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s space, they carry along the flashes of those characters along. Result: the comparisons happen! Thus it becomes the starsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ responsibility to satisfy the viewers and help them forget the comparisons with their extra dose of well-delivered performance.\n\nKaram JoharÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Agneepath is the remake of the 90s hit with the same titled in which Amitabh Bachchan had played the main character of Vijay Dinanath Chauhan. The film brought National Award for Mr. Bachchan in return to his classy performance in the movie. The film was produced by KaranÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father Yash Johar. Twenty two years later, the son took the command to remake fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hit with the debutante director Karan Malhotra, who makes the current Agneepath as per the taste of the todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s audience to dish out to the viewers to get entertained with. Malhotra puts new additions to the script to make it slightly different from the original like he introduced the new negative character of Rauf Lala (Rishi Kapoor). But the main plot is same ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the revenge saga.\n\nDebutante KaranÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s execution further makes the product contemporary for the audiences who view it as if they are watching a new flick. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the beauty and the skill of the director. Hrithik Roshan slips into the strapping character of Vijay Dinanath Chauhan played by the legendary Amitabh Bachchan twenty two years back. The all time favorite dialogue ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Naam Vijay ChauhanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Baap Ka Naam Dinanath ChauhanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is the one that had made the flick to super heights in 90s and the same dialogue is going to do something super lucrative for Karan JoharÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s product.\n\nKaran MalhotraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Agneepath has all ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ action, vengeance, drama, emotions and entertainment. You are rest assured to enjoy the ride with one package that is what the first time director confers his viewers with.  Karan shows his class on the celluloid. Since the director knew that the viewers would make the comparisons, he gave the fresh touch to each character in style and other things. He proves that he is a great storyteller. From his job of direction, it cannot be figured out that he is a debutante in the field.\n\nAgneepath talks about a tiny village called Mandwa where the principled father Dinnaanth (Chetan Pandit) teaches his son Vijay Dinnanath Chauhan (Hrithik Roshan) all about the fire (Agneepath). The happy life of the Dinnanath family gets ruined and Vijay is smashed when the drug dealer of the area Kancha (Sanjay Dutt) murders VijayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father. His mother (Zarina Wahab) is pregnant. Vijay and his mother leave the place and arrives in Mumbai where he bumps into the gang lord Rauf Lala (Rishi Kapoor). Rauf becomes the Godfather of the little Vijay Chauhan. Here starts his journey of revenge, which he has in his heart for Kancha, and in the process he gets the supporting hand of his love interest Kali (Priyanka Chopra). Vijay moors the belts to head to Mandwa fifteen years later to seek vengeance.\n\nAgneepathÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s power lies in the mastery skill of the director and the script writers they do not let the film loss its flavor. There is hardly any moment where the movie falls flat or runs short of content. The sequences between Vijay and Kancha are what simply capture the whole attention of the viewers. The drama in the movie, where many first time directors even the established directors shake, is well handled by Karan Malhotra.\n\nKaran Malhotra has done his job with finesse and class. He surely has a good scope in the days to come and many big budgeted films will wait him for sure. Even Karan Johar will certainly offer him many projects to do. The action sequences by Abbas Ali Mogul need and deserve special applauds. The viewers who love action movies will find this product superb to satisfy their thirst. The audiences simply enjoy every sequence and every scene was entertained with big noise. The action sequence in the finale loots the viewersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ hearts.\n\nAjay-AtulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music is splendid though there is hardly any song which turned chartbuster except Chikni Chameli but they all are listenable and mellifluous. Chikini Chameli, which is picturised on Katrina Kaif, has been doing supremely on all channels. The item song has surely added many sparkles to filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth. Katrina looks damn sexy and gorgeous in the song. It was created for the movieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hype and it did wonders. The background score has also been done by the duo Ajay-Atul and it is superb. Screenplay by Ila Bedi Datta and Karan Malhotra is a masterpiece carries no flaws at all. Dialogues by Piyush Mishra are splendid. Cinematography done by Kiran Deohans and Ravi K. Chandran is a class in itself.\n\nHrithik Roshan has done wonderful job with the iconic character of Vijay Dinnanath Chauhan with such brilliance that the viewer claps with praise. He does full justice to AmitabhÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s character. Sanjay Dutt as Kancha is magnificent. His negative role surpasses his previous negative roles he did in Khal Nayak and Vaastav. He allures the hearts and souls. Hrithik Roshan and Sanjay Dutt will surely be nominated for Best Actor and Best VillainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s categories in the awards functions to come. And Karan JoharÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s movie too will find its space in the nomination of Best Movie.  Rishi Kapoor impresses with his role. He has done the role, which he has never attempted in his career. Priyanka Chopra is great to watch. Zarina Wahab is good. Rest of the cast too is brilliant.\n\nFinal Verdict by the Critic:\n\nAgneepath is sure to be a big hit. The film will witness bigger collections at the box office with magnificent direction, powerful script and brilliant performances.  A MUST WATCH!\n\n\nAGNEEPATH 2012 Hindi PDVDRip x264 AC3 DON RAJ\n\n\n\nafter Download please keep seed &amp; write your comments\n\t....PLEASE KEEP SEEDING.... PLEASE KEEP SEEDING....
