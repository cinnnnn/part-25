The song is intrinsically\nlinked to this band, brainchild of David LaFlamme, a virtuoso violinist who frequently \njammed alongside the likes of Jerry Garcia and Janis Joplin. Their original line-up \nincluded Patti Santos on vocals, David's own wife Linda LaFlamme on keyboards, Hal \nWagenet on guitar, Mitchell Holman on bass and Val Fluentes on drums. Through numerous \npersonnel changes, ongoing legal disputes over royalties and various setbacks \n(the LaFlamme's own divorce and then Linda Laflamme having to hand over her keyboard \nduties after being struck in the head by a bottle thrown from the audience), the \ngroup released three studio albums. A nasty lawsuit then saw David LaFlamme forced \nout of the band he had created. With a new violinist, keyboard player and still more \nmusicians passing through the revolving doors, the band eventually issued two rather \ndisappointing albums and then fizzled out of the picture. Late-period members such \nas bassist Bud Cockrell and guitarist David Jenkins resurfaced in PABLO CRUISE while \nDavid LaFlamme and Patti Santos enjoyed low-key solo careers. Patti (the voice of \n&quot;White Bird&quot;) was killed in a car accident in 1989.\n\nTheir eponymous first album is an American masterpiece of finely crafted, classically \ninspired folk-rock structured around violinist LaFlamme's virtuosity. A combination \nof San Francisco Bay Area psychedelia, folk, classical and jazz, it has a very 60ish \n'trippy' feel. &quot;Marrying Maiden&quot;, their second release, is exceedingly pastoral \ncompared to the first, as the band switched to earthier, country-flavoured rock with \ncajun spices, bits of jazz and good old-time rock'n roll. By the time the third album \n&quot;Choice Quality Stuff / Anytime&quot; was released in '72, David LaFlamme was being ousted \nand the band altogether had seen so many personnel changes it was becoming something \nof a loose aggregate of the Bay Area 'all stars' (among whom were several members \nfrom SANTANA). Although not a bad album, &quot;Choice Quality Stuff&quot; with its distinctly \nblues-based rock'n roll is nothing remotely similar to the first. Two subsequent \nLPs, released in '73 and '74 respectively, feature yet another string of new musicians \nand don't have much to offer to progheads.\n\nThe first album is a true American classic and is highly recommended to fans of \nearly RENAISSANCE and ILLUSION. The lighter &quot;Marrying Maiden&quot;, still featuring stellar \ninstrumentation and haunting vocals, is a good runner-up.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd4e09f0a04d74a8a7679ecb617d3904db40a2ad","amp;dn":"It%27s+A+Beautiful+Day+Discography+FLAC+Vinyl+24-96%2B+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd4e09f0a04d74a8a7679ecb617d3904db40a2ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,78,9,240,160,77,116,168,167,103,158,203,97,125,57,4,219,64,162,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
