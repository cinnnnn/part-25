CentOS conforms fully with the upstream vendor's redistribution policy and aims to be 100% binary compatible. (CentOS mainly changes packages to remove upstream vendor branding and artwork.)  CentOS is free.\n\nCentOS is developed by a small but growing team of core developers.  In turn the core developers are supported by an active user community including system administrators, network administrators, enterprise users, managers, core Linux contributors and Linux enthusiasts from around the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b39d8934a3dd237132f4ec39396824858bdac036","amp;dn":"CentOS+5.10+i386","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b39d8934a3dd237132f4ec39396824858bdac036","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,157,137,52,163,221,35,113,50,244,236,57,57,104,36,133,139,218,192,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
