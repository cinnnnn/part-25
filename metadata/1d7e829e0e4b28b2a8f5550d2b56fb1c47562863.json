It is very listenable with the exception of &quot;Pass Me By&quot;. The album starts out very strong: &quot;Emily&quot;, &quot;Here's to the Losers&quot;, &quot;Dear Heart&quot;, &quot;Come Blow your Horn&quot; are great tunes - the Nelson Riddle arrangements are all superior.\n\nThe album takes a serious dip with &quot;Pass Me By&quot;, a number that sounds like it would be perfectly suited for a 1960s Rankin/Bass stop-animation classic (it is actually from a 1964 Cary Grant romantic-comedy &quot;Father Goose&quot; - which, along with the backgound vocals, explains the extremely dated sound).\n\nI have to make a special note of &quot;Then Suddenly Love&quot;... it is one of my all-time favorite tunes. It swings with fine horn arrangements, jazzy drum riffs and an extremely buoyant performance by Sinatra. I don't know many people who know the song, but anyone I've played it for thinks it is a blast and a &quot;must-have&quot;... you can't help but dance, snap your fingers, or tap your toes to it. Silly lyrics? I don't listen to Frank for his messages - this song is fun, romantic and joyous... everything being in love should be. Why this song isn't considered a standard is beyond me.
