It sounds like Bon Jovi, but it sounds fresh. We experimented with a lot of new sounds and had a really good time working with John Shanks, who is also a really good guitar player, so he and I did a lot of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“weaselingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ with the guitar sounds. There are a lot of really good guitar sounds and new kind atmospheres on the new Bon Jovi record, that I think makes it really modern. I think people are going to dig it, man. And it rocks hard.&quot;\n\nThe Circle Tour will ensue the following year, &quot;2010, probably spring time weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll get going. And weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to go for a long time.
