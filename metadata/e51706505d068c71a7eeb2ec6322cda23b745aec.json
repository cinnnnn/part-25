One thing that every prospective purchaser in the U.S. should consider: the four discs that this set draws from can be swooped up in one shot at your average used shop for roughly the same cost; you can find any one of them for a couple bucks a piece. \r\nDiehards remain in need of a thorough B-sides compilation from these years -- some are probably still stinging from having to hunt down all those multi-format singles for the elusive non-album tracks.
