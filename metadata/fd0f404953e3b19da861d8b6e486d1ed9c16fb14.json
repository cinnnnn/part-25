Arguing that the United\nStates should create a market for sick people, in\nwhich health plans vigorously compete to solve the\nproblems of diabetics, asthmatics, heart patients,\ncancer patients, and others with high expected\nhealth care costs, this book maintains that every\nexample of a center of excellenceÃ¢â‚¬â€producing high\nquality, low-cost careÃ¢â‚¬â€originated from the supply\nside of the market, not the demand side. With\npractical advice on how typical employers can cut\nemployee health costs in half, this handbook also\nexamines a variety of health-related topics,\nincluding malpractice, insurance reform, and the\ninstitution of a privatized Medicare program.\n\nPriceless: Curing the Healthcare Crisis\n(Independent Studies in Political Economy)\nby John C.
