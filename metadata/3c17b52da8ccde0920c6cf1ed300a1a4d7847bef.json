Music by HOWARD SHORE. 25 TRACKS. TOTAL LENGTH=61m.17s. FLAC format.\n\n\nThis is not the mediocre 'various artists' compilation that was released on its day. If you are a fan of the movie or Howard Shore, this is a must have. This soundtrack is quite rare and limited (as a matter of fact, I think it is a 'bootleg' of sorts), so please help me seed it for a while. Thank you and enjoy.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.monstersinmotion.com/cart/soundtracks-item-list-s-c-12_85/seven-soundtrack-cd-howard-shore-p-3281&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.monstersinmotion.com/cart/soundtracks-item-list-s-c-12_85/seven-soundtrack-cd-howard-shore-p-3281&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c17b52da8ccde0920c6cf1ed300a1a4d7847bef","amp;dn":"%5C%27+Se7en+%5C%27+%28Original+Motion+ore%29+music+by+Howard+Shore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c17b52da8ccde0920c6cf1ed300a1a4d7847bef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,23,181,45,168,204,222,9,32,198,207,30,211,0,161,164,215,132,123,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
