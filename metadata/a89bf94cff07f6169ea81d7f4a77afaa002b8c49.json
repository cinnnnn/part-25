After offering a reference frame and defining the objectives (chapter 1), &quot;physiology&quot; (chapter 2) is presented as a source material followed by &quot;signals&quot; (chapter 3) and &quot;signal pick up&quot; (chapter 4). Chapter 5 deals with the biological amplifier. Reading the signal and the need for mathematical models are the subject matter, respectively, of chapters 6 and 7; they only provide guidance. The last chapter tries to look ahead. Sometimes, the subject is treated in relative depth; at times, the visit is more superficial. Formation rather than information is favored. Historical shots supply background material and spicy insights. Style is light, sprinkled with a little humor. There are exercises which allow students to learn independently","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a89bf94cff07f6169ea81d7f4a77afaa002b8c49","amp;dn":"Understanding+The+Human+Machine+-+A+Primer+For+Bioengineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a89bf94cff07f6169ea81d7f4a77afaa002b8c49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,155,249,76,255,7,246,22,158,168,29,127,74,119,175,170,0,43,140,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
