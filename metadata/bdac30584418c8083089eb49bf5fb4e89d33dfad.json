Following the recording of this album, Stanley Larsson left the group and was replaced by Thomas Wiklund, formerly of UppÃƒÂ¥t VÃƒÂ¤ggarna. \n\nThe group's final album, Reload, was released in 1975 and the group split, with Roger going on to join Wasa Express.\n\nPiero attempted to reform the group with all new members in 1977, but this incarnation disbanded after recording a few demos. In 1981, the group reformed with Piero and Benno and several new members. They recorded one single for Rosa Honung Records which was never issued.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal Members:\n\n\nRoger HolegÃƒÂ¥rd: vocals, guitar, mellotron\n\nPiero Mengarelli: guitar\n\nGunnar Hallin:guitar (1974Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1975)\n\nBenno Mengarelli: bass\n\nKenta Krull: drums (1969Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1973)\n\nStanley Larsson: drums (1973Ã¢â‚¬â€œ75)\n\nThomas Wiklund: drums (1975)\n\n\n\n1981 Reunion Members:\n\n\nPiero Mengarelli: guitar\n\nBenno Mengarelli: bass\n\nJoaquin Calafell: drums\n\nErik Svensson: keyboards\n\nConny Bloom: guitar and vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdac30584418c8083089eb49bf5fb4e89d33dfad","amp;dn":"Neon+Rose+-+Reload+%5B1975%5D%5B2005%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdac30584418c8083089eb49bf5fb4e89d33dfad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,172,48,88,68,24,200,8,48,137,235,73,191,95,180,232,157,51,223,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
