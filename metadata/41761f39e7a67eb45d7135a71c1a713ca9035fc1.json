Whistance, David R. Sherwood (1973).pdf\r\n\r\nFrom development of the initial requirements to final drawings used in construction, this authoritative reference for the design and drafting of industrial piping systems provides a step-by-step guide to piping design. Created as an in-depth resource for professionals, this piping bible is as valuable in the field as it is in the office or the classroom. Among the topics covered in this encyclopedic survey are techniques of piping design, the assembly of piping from components, processes for connecting piping to equipment, office organization, methods to translate concepts into finished designs, and terms and abbreviations concerned. An expansive selection of charts and tables presents a wide array of informationâ€”frequently used data; factors for establishing pipeways width; spacing between pipes with and without flanges and for â€œjumpoversâ€ and â€œrunarounds;â€ principal dimensions and weights for key components; conversion for customary and metric units; direct-reading metric conversion tables for dimensions and data; and a metric supplement with principal dimensional data in millimetersâ€”handily organized for quick reference","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41761f39e7a67eb45d7135a71c1a713ca9035fc1","amp;dn":"The+Piping+Guide+-+Dennis+J.+Whistance%2C+David+R.+Sherwood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41761f39e7a67eb45d7135a71c1a713ca9035fc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,118,31,57,231,166,126,180,93,113,53,167,28,26,113,60,169,3,95,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
