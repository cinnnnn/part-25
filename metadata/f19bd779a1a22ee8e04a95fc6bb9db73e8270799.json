It was not as easy as downloading the stream's flash video file because there is no download allowed at http://www.cbc.ca/littlemosque/episodes.html, as opposed to some other TV show sites (from which I've dlded plenty of streaming flv). However, I noticed that watching the video stream on my broadband connection had no hiccups nor delays so I decided to screen-capture the video and see what kind of quality I could get. I got better than I thought so here's the torrent.\n\nScreen capture of on-screen video stream\nSoftware: Replay Video Capture 3.1 (http://www.applian.com/replay-video-capture/welcome.php); torrent - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4610008\nSettings: 2000 kbps V-bitrate, 128 kbps A-bitrate, 30 fps, MPEG-2 output\nResult: 324 MB mpg file, 576x320, runtime of 22:20\n\nConversion of mpg to avi\nSoftware: Magic Video Converter 8.0.2.18; torrent - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4829895\nSettings: 1000 kbps total avg bitrate (128 mp3 stereo audio), 30 fps, DivX 3 low AVI output, original frame size\nResult: 160 MB avi file, 576x320, runtime of 22:20\n\nThis episode should be watched at native size (576 pixels by 320 pixels) or close to it, because the original stream's resolution was never meant for full-screen viewing. Audio is clear and well-synched (matches original). The video quality is quite a bit better than the existing torrent's avi (compare file sizes - 160 MB vs. 65 MB) but, obviously, it does not even come close to an HDTV-sourced avi. Hope you can enjoy the episode, nonetheless. I sure did.\n\nCheers to all from QG\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f19bd779a1a22ee8e04a95fc6bb9db73e8270799","amp;dn":"Little.Mosque.On.The.Prairie.S03E17.StreamCap.DivX-QG.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f19bd779a1a22ee8e04a95fc6bb9db73e8270799","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,155,215,121,161,162,46,232,224,74,149,252,107,185,219,115,232,39,7,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
