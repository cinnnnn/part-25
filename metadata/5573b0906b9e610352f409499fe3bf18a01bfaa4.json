It is particularly this spirit which is expressed so eloquently by Oscar Grillo in the etchings, watercolour sketches and oil paintings which illustrate the pages of this diary. They are in no way direct copies, but they do refer to Rembrandt's work in terms of subjects, style and period, encouraging us to discover and explore the rich world of Rembrandt's art.
