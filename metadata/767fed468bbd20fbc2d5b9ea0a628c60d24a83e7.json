I would describe the\npicture quality as more than reasonable considering the source and the fact most\nof the documentary is  made from old archived  video footage.  The was  a lot of\nhiss on the recording, which has been removed, so the sound quality is ok \nbut not brilliant.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDocumentary  series detailing  the lives  of a  group of  reckless gamblers  and\nchancers who all belonged to a notorious gambling club in the 60s - the Clermont\nClub. All of them were instrumental in changing the structure of political power\nin Britain.\n \n\nPart  1: Who  Pays Wins  \nThis episode  delves  into  the life   of Colonel  David  Sterling,  founder  of\nthe  British   Special Air   Service  (SAS)  commando  unit.  Following his army\nstint  in  World  War  II,  Sterling  became  a  prime  mover  in  a series   of\nmercenary  and  arms-dealing schemes  in  the  Third  World. The  UK government,\nof course, sanctioned these schemes. This documentary fills in  some interesting\nbackground to British intrigue in Saudi Arabia &amp; Yemen in the 1960s,  ultimately\nsetting the  stage for current  troubles  in the  Persian Gulf region. The  film\nalso briefly mentions SterlingÃƒÆ’?s odd activities in pre-independence Rhodesia. \n\n\nN.B: The final 15mins of this episode are missing.\n\n\nPart 2: Entrepreneur Spelt S.P.I.V.\nIn the 1950s, Britain was  dominated by a political and  financial establishment\nthat looked  down on  the stock  market. But  a suburban  accountant called  Jim\nSlater realised that if he harnessed the sleeping powers of the shareholders,\nhe would gain immense power.\n\n\nPart 3:    Destroy the Technostructure\nThis episode recounts the story of how James Goldsmith became one of the richest\nmen in the world by taking over some of the biggest corporations in America.\n\n\nPart 4: Twilight of the Dogs\nBy the 80s, the day of the buccaneering tycoons was over. Tiny Rowland, \nJames Goldsmith and Mohammed Al Fayed were the only ones who were not finished.\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:767fed468bbd20fbc2d5b9ea0a628c60d24a83e7","amp;dn":"The+Mayfair+Set+1999+Adam+Curtis+-+BBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"767fed468bbd20fbc2d5b9ea0a628c60d24a83e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,127,237,70,139,189,32,251,194,213,185,234,10,98,140,96,210,74,131,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
