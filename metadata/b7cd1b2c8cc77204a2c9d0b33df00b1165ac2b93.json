In a new afterword, Herman offers a lucid and thorough overview of the knowledge that has developed about incest and other forms of sexual abuse since this book was first published.\n\nReviewing the extensive research literature that demonstrates the validity of incest survivors' sometimes repressed and recovered memories, she convincingly challenges the rhetoric and methods of the backlash movement against incest survivors, and the concerted attempt to deny the events they find the courage to describe.\n\nPublisher: Harvard University Press (May 5, 2000)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0674002709\nISBN-13: 978-0674002708","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7cd1b2c8cc77204a2c9d0b33df00b1165ac2b93","amp;dn":"Father-Daughter+Incest%2C+Judith+Herman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7cd1b2c8cc77204a2c9d0b33df00b1165ac2b93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,205,27,44,140,199,114,4,162,201,208,179,61,240,11,17,101,172,43,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
