To help Turbo Granny; lean back and forward on your cool permobile as you climb the hills and fly through the air using accelerometer technology.\n\nThe nursing home is awfully boring!\n\nTurbo Granny may be as old as the hills, but she canÃ‚Â´t stand spending every day indoors at the slow nursing home. ItÃ‚Â´s deadening &amp; Turbo Granny is bored to death! She misses all the action and excitement that she used to experience - a long time agoÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and that is why she one day has had it; Turbo Granny takes her permobile and gets the h*** out the nursing home!

If so, she could take the easiest way, the Mountain track. At the Mountain track there will be some off-road driving with quite a few nasty jumps on the way. In order to complete the track sheÃ‚Â´d better have a rally vehicleÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nEager to go, Turbo Granny? Then she should take the Suburbia track, itÃ‚Â´s the best route for her to take - on her speedy vehicleÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nUp for a challenge, Turbo Granny? If it is a truly courageous Granny she should however opt for the Desert track. \n\nThe Desert track is a really difficult cross track, in fact it is so difficult that if completed it is very doubtful that the nursing home staff will catch up with her - everÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nWhat's New:\n\n- Added LasVegas!\n- Updated moregames\n- Fixed Heyzap issues\n- Minor bugfixes\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imperialgamestudio.turbogrannies&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imperialgamestudio.turbogrannies&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5e2f06abedfef44c7c91270bce757c51e2473da","amp;dn":"Turbo+Grannies+v1.1.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5e2f06abedfef44c7c91270bce757c51e2473da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,226,240,106,190,223,239,68,199,201,18,112,188,231,87,197,30,36,115,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
