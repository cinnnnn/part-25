Using a combination of interview materials, survey data, and historical materials, it explores the relationship between humor and gender, age, social class, and national differences in the Netherlands and the United States. The exploration of social differences in sense of humor starts off from one specific, and not very prestigious, humorous genre: the joke. Good Humor, Bad Taste explains why jokes are good humor to some, bad taste to others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:635a695acd0ff12e89875a2bd756ed6e48da3e7d","amp;dn":"Good+Humor%2C+Bad+Taste+-+Giselende+Kuipers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"635a695acd0ff12e89875a2bd756ed6e48da3e7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,90,105,90,205,15,241,46,137,135,90,43,215,86,237,110,72,218,62,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
