They soon teamed up with drummer Fredrik &quot;Trisse&quot; Liefvendahl and recorded a three track demo. This recording led to an appearance on the Waterdragon Records compilation, Greatest Hits Vol. 1 (2000). After this compilation they put out a split 7&quot; with Spiritual Beggars (who JB would later join) on Southern Lord Records. This split was followed closely by their debut album, Grand Magus (2001), on Rise Above Records. Two more albums would follow, Monument (2003) and Wolf's Return (2005), both on Rise Above. In 2006 Trisse left the band and Sebastian &quot;SEB&quot; Sippola was recruited on drums. The band released their fourth album, Iron Will, on June 9, 2008 on Rise Above. On December 2009 Roadrunner records announced they are releasing Grand Magus fifth album called Hammer of the North in summer of 2010. The news is posted on their website.\nMembers\nCurrent line-up\nrand Magus - The Hunt (Limited Edition) - 2012/07.
