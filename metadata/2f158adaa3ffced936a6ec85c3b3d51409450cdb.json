To say Slade Ham slayed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“em would not only be an atrocious pun but the simple truth. You only wish this audience had been miked so you too can hear some of their comments and verbal reactions. Ham is a tell the truth, dark, observational comic who spares no one. Perhaps there are a couple too many fat jokes but his range more than makes up for that.\n\nRedemption begins with an observation on how non-smokers have become unbearable and just another sign we live in a childproof world. Ham is very good at interacting with the audience so those bits, though not perfect sound wise, are quite fun. He also tells funny stories such as the Banana Lady and minor political commentary such as his take on Abu Graib.\n\nYou cannot possibly to stand-up in Texas without talking about rednecks. Ham's take on rednecks is not the nice Jeff Foxworthy version and much more the trailer trash park view. Other targets are nerds who dress up to a Star Wars premiere, California disasters, and, of course, relationships.\n\nNo doubt the best of the very good bits on Redemption by Slade Ham is Slade vs. Screech where he tells the story of appearing on the same bill as Dustin Diamond (of Saved By The Bell fame). This is the only time I have ever heard one comic put down another comic on his funny CD.\n\nSome listeners will definitely be uncomfortable with Ham's very laidback attitude towards drinking and drinking and driving, others with the fat jokes, others with something else. Then again, this is a very funny comic whose set is not successful if he hasn't made you squirm once.\n\n\nFrom: http://www.sladeham.com\n\nSlade Ham is not standard fare in the comedy world. Over the last ten years, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s generated a cult following of not only his stand up but of the volumes of online Rants he churns out weekly. From social issues to the perils of his previous eight year, train wreck relationship, SladeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s show takes you places you thought only you had beenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and when itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s over, you realize thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hope at the end of it all. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not motivational or inspirational; itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just true. \n\nA veteran of multiple USO tours for our troops overseas, Slade has taken his trademark brand of intensity to over twenty countries on four different continents, leaving audiences howling every time. Off stage, Slade lends his talents to the production of independent films, most recently starring in and co-directing the award winning &quot;Fist Full of Pills&quot; along with fellow Texas comedian Tom Hester.  The film was showcased at the Montreal Just For Laughs Festival and was the recipient of an Honorable Mention, coming in second only to a Kevin Pollack film. The follow up, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKill WhiteyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, featuring the same creative team, is scheduled to debut in Montreal in 2007. \n\nIn addition to headlining some of the finest clubs in the nation this past year, Slade was also invited by Christopher Titus to open at the taping of his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ5th Annual End of the World TourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for Comedy Central at the South Beach Comedy Festival.\n\nIn 2006 Slade had the honor of headlining XM RadioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBest of TexasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ two hour special, and his 2nd CD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRedemptionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ remains one of XM ComedyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most requested.  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRedemptionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ also features original music from Kevin Martin of Candlebox fame, and receives almost daily airplay on XM Channel 150. His third project keeps getting the release date pushed back because Slade can't ever seem to decide when he's ready to record.\n\nOriginal, fast paced, and always putting the audience firstÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Slade Ham is on the verge of something huge. The crowd simply never leaves disappointed. More importantly though, they leave as fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f158adaa3ffced936a6ec85c3b3d51409450cdb","amp;dn":"Stand+Up+Comedy+-+Slade+Ham+-+Redemption+%282005%29+mp3_192+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f158adaa3ffced936a6ec85c3b3d51409450cdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,21,138,218,163,255,206,217,54,166,236,133,195,179,213,20,9,69,12,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
