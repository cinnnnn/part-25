It is long out of print and since you cannot buy it anymore, I decided to share it with Lightfoot fans who are trying to find a copy.  This copy is a little crackly so, I apoligise in advance....\n\nI would not share the music if it was otherwise available.\n\nStats:  Original Pressing\n        United Artists - 1968\n        Dual CS16-1214 Turntable\n        Shure M75 Cartridge / RS70 Stylus\n        MP3 - 320kps\n\nPlease give me your Feedback and Seed.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nWaxman\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeb858cf6b07562f41ee5f56ff196627116d03d3","amp;dn":"Gordon+Lightfoot+-+Did+She+Mention+My+name+-+320kps+-+Vinyl+Dub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeb858cf6b07562f41ee5f56ff196627116d03d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,184,88,207,107,7,86,47,65,238,95,86,255,25,102,39,17,109,3,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
