Wanting to bring some of their lesser known franchises to groups outside of their fanbase, Sega AM2 is porting F355 Challenge to PlayStation 2. Gameplay details on the game are very limited at the moment but, like the Dreamcast version, F355 on PlayStation 2 will allow gamers to play around on such world-famous courses as Monza, Suzuka, Motegi, Long Beach, and Fiorano.\n\n\nDo you missing a game? Write a comment with the game you want and I will try to upload that game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fc1b02b6c3abf98c6ea9b27201caafb1f6dee21","amp;dn":"Ferrari+F355+Challenge+%5BPS2%5D+%5BPAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fc1b02b6c3abf98c6ea9b27201caafb1f6dee21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,193,176,43,108,58,191,152,198,234,155,39,32,28,170,251,31,109,238,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
