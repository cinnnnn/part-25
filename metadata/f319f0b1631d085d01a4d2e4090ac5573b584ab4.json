It was originally released on 1 September 1983 and included the hits, &quot;Red, Red Wine&quot; (UK #1, US #1), &quot;Cherry Oh Baby&quot; (UK #12), &quot;Many Rivers to Cross&quot; (UK #16), and &quot;Please Don't Make Me Cry&quot; (UK #10). \n\nThe entire album consists of cover versions of songs originally released by the group's musical idols. The most notable track is the cover of Neil Diamond's &quot;Red, Red Wine,&quot; which reached #1 in the United Kingdom upon its release. The song was re-released in the United States in 1988, where it also topped the chart. The album and 12&quot; version included a toasted verse by Astro, later copied by Neil Diamond in his live performances. \n\nThe album reached #1 in the UK and #8 in the United States. With the inclusion of the new version of &quot;Red, Red Wine,&quot; the album regained popularity in 1988 and climbed to #15 in the U.S. \n\nIn 1989, it was ranked #98 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the 80s. \n\nThe band members began as friends who knew each other from various schools across Birmingham. The name &quot;UB40&quot; was selected in reference to the document issued to people claiming unemployment benefit from the UK government's Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) at the time of the band's formation. The designation UB40 stood for Unemployment Benefit, Form 40.\n\nUB40 is one of the most commercially successful reggae acts of all time in terms of record sales, chart positions and touring schedule. During their three-decade long career, they have been performing sell-out shows worldwide and headlining the Reggae Sunsplash music festival in Jamaica, as well as spreading reggae to Russia, South America, etc. They have performed twice at the Night of the Proms, in 2000 and in 2006. In 2006 UB40 was nominated for a Grammy Award (Reggae category) for their album Who You Fighting For.\n(video has a semi-transparent white &quot;einsfestival&quot; logo at the top right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_of_Love&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_of_Love&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PAfeAAAeH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PAfeAAAeH&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 9640kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:16\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
