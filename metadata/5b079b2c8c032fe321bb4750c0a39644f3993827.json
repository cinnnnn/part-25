Cricket has enthralled us since the seventeenth century. But what is it about the game that provokes such fervour? Award-winning sports author Gavin Mortimer calls together a cast of salt-of-the-earth Yorkshiremen, American billionaires and dashing Indian princes to tell the strange and remarkable tale of cricket's journey from medieval village sport of 'club-ball' to the global media circus graced by superstars from Denis Compton to Sachin Tendulkar. If you've ever wanted to know what a hoop skirt has to do with overarm bowling, why England fight Australia over a burnt bail, or how to avoid tickling a jaffa in the corridor of uncertainty, Mortimer chalks up a stunning century of tales in the first truly accessible global history of cricket","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b079b2c8c032fe321bb4750c0a39644f3993827","amp;dn":"A+History+of+Cricket+in+100+Objects","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b079b2c8c032fe321bb4750c0a39644f3993827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,7,155,44,140,3,47,227,33,187,71,80,192,163,150,68,243,153,56,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
