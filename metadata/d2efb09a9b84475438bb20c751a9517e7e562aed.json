Ing'er, the daughter of a theatre-owner, welcomes the return of Shao-dung, her fiancee and a fine cellist from America. Shao-dung soon finds himself captivated by the opera &quot;Fleeing By Night&quot; and its celebrated actor, Lin Chung, whose voice seems to articulate something within himself. While Shao-dung attempts to blend eastern and western music, Ing'er becomes torn between her affection for both men, and an awareness of the growing intimacy between them.\n\n\n02:00:00\n640x480\n23.976 FPS\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2efb09a9b84475438bb20c751a9517e7e562aed","amp;dn":"e+2000+Ye+Ben+%5BFleeing+by+Night%5D+%28TAI-CHN%29+%5BEngHSub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2efb09a9b84475438bb20c751a9517e7e562aed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,239,176,154,155,132,71,84,56,187,32,199,81,169,81,126,126,86,42,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
