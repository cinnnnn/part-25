A kind, sensitive, family man, he is also prone to irascible outbursts against the people he must work for, now that he can no longer make his living from the sea.\n\nPierce's one great passion, a fifty-foot fishing boat called Spartina, lies unfinished in his back yard. Determined to get the funds he needs to buy her engine, he finds himself taking a foolish, dangerous risk. But his real test comes when he must weather a storm at sea in order to keep his dream alive. Moving and poetic, Spartina is a masterly story of one man's ongoing struggle to find his place in the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbc1fe249d9e8b4213d3521c575c3bbaca40d22e","amp;dn":"Spartina+by+John+D+Casey+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbc1fe249d9e8b4213d3521c575c3bbaca40d22e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,193,254,36,157,158,139,66,19,211,82,28,87,92,59,186,202,64,210,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
