Their best known songs include &quot;What Kind of Love is This&quot;, &quot;One More Time&quot; and their version of &quot;Under My Thumb&quot;.\n\n\nIn 1975, vocalist Ken Shields (born in Nokomis, Saskatchewan), keyboard player Daryl Gutheil and bassist Ken Sinnaeve formed the band Wascana. After being renamed Witness, the group became Streetheart when guitarist Paul Dean and drummer Matt Frenette joined in 1977. The band released Meanwhile Back in Paris the following year and Under Heaven over Hell in 1979, after which Frenette and Dean dropped out to form Loverboy. In 1980 Streetheart won the Juno Award for &quot;Most Promising Group of the Year&quot;.\n\nArguably Streetheart's most popular single was a 1979 cover version of &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; by the Rolling Stones (an early Streetheart influence). Streetheart's version achieved gold single status in Canada.\n\nFor the next four years they released a string of albums: Quicksand Shoes (1980), Drugstore Dancer (1980), Action: Best of Streetheart (1981), the self-titled Streetheart (1982), Dancing with Danger (1983), and the double live album Live After Dark (1983). Record sales earned them six gold albums and four platinum albums in Canada. The band broke-up in 1983, after which a collection of unreleased songs called Buried Treasures was released in 1984.\n\nFrehley's Comet recorded their own version of &quot;Dancing with Danger&quot; for their 1988 album, Second Sighting. In 1991, Hardline recorded their own version of the Streetheart song &quot;Hot Cherie&quot; for their 1992 album, Double Eclipse.\n\nAt the peak of their career, Streetheart toured with several Canadian rock bands including Chilliwack, Rush, Toronto, Harlequin, Max Webster, Aldo Nova, April Wine, Headpins; American bands including Sammy Hagar, Styx, Kansas, Blue ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œyster Cult, and with Australia's AC/DC.\n\nStreetheart received a Juno Award, two Ampex Golden Reel awards, a Chimo Award from Music Express Magazine, and were voted the most popular Canadian act in the Peoples' Choice Awards. In 2003, Streetheart was inducted into the Western Canadian Music Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2008 the band released a 2-CD retrospective collection titled ...Read All About It - The Hits/Anthology. The band continues to tour Canada in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Essential 2005\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nUnder My Thumb\nHollywood\nHere Comes the Night\nWhat Kind of Love is This\nAction\nTin Soldier\nMain Street\nLook at Me\nPressure\nCan You Feel It\nMiss Plaza Suite\nJokeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s on You\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d865a86591bced1933bf37bf9eb8b8799fd161f4","amp;dn":"Streetheart+-+Essential+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2005+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d865a86591bced1933bf37bf9eb8b8799fd161f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,101,168,101,145,188,237,25,51,191,55,191,158,184,184,121,159,209,97,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
