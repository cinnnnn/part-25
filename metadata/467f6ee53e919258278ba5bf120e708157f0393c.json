Featuring a newly minted lineup of his '70s electric band, Taking Another Look features keyboardist Mike Logan, guitarist Henry Johnson, bassist Joshua Ramos, and drummer Charles Heath, all of whom reveal a knack for the funky, soulful jazz Lewis is reinvestigating here. Included are reworkings such classic '70s tracks as &quot;Tambura,&quot; &quot;Love Song,&quot; and &quot;Jungle Strut.&quot; These are dance-oriented jazz-funk cuts with an organic, groove-oriented vibe that stick closely to the original '70s conception. In fact, the original version of Lewis' hit &quot;Sun Goddess&quot; is included and rounds out the album nicely. Which isn't to say that this is solely a retro-leaning venture. On the contrary, as with the rest of the album, tracks such as the dramatic, midtempo funk number &quot;To Know Her&quot; and the lush ballad &quot;Sharing Her Journey&quot; are expertly produced contemporary jazz numbers.\n\nProduct Details\nRelease Date: 9/20/2011\nLabel: Hidden Beach\nUPC: 897352002062\nCatalog Number: 105","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:467f6ee53e919258278ba5bf120e708157f0393c","amp;dn":"Ramsey+Lewis+Feat+The+Electric+Band+-+Taking+Another+Look+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"467f6ee53e919258278ba5bf120e708157f0393c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,127,110,229,62,145,146,88,39,139,165,191,18,14,112,129,87,240,57,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
