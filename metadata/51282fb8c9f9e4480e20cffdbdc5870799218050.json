It was filmed in Everett, Washington and starred Tim Daly as Kimble, Mykelti Williamson as Gerard, and Stephen Lang as the one-armed man. CBS canceled the series after one season of 22 episodes, leaving a cliffhanger unresolved. The show was the first lead-in to CSI: Crime Scene Investigation on Friday nights, which became a hit when it debuted the same year. This incarnation was produced by Arnold Kopelson and Warner Brothers, the producers of the 1993 film (The Fugitive).\n\n\nPlot Summary:\nDr. Richard Kimble is framed for his wife's murder by a mysterious one-armed man. During sentencing, Kimble escapes and then pursues the one-armed man so that justice would prevail, and to find out why he was framed. Following in hot pursuit is Inspector Philip Gerard, who is intending to bring Kimble in alive. But Gerard and the one-armed man are not the only things Kimble has to worry about. The father of his late wife has hired bounty hunters who are willing to break the law to catch him, and in the age of internet tracking and high-tech surveillance, it's not as easy to hide as it used to be.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51282fb8c9f9e4480e20cffdbdc5870799218050","amp;dn":"The+Fugitive+TV+Series+%282000-2001%29+-+1+season+%5Brevised%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51282fb8c9f9e4480e20cffdbdc5870799218050","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,40,47,184,201,249,228,72,14,32,207,253,189,197,135,7,153,33,128,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
