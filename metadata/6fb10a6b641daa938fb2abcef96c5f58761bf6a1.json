Like A G6 is by far the most remixed song of the past year. That is why this torrent contains 10 of the most awesome remixes, of course all in 320 kbps, plus the original song. I tried to include as many genres as possible, still most are electro/house.\n\n\nArtist...............: Far East Movement, The Cataracs, Dev\nAlbum................: Like A G6 (Remix Pack)\nGenre................: Various\nYear.................: 2011\nCover................: Yes\nM3U..................: Yes\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3\n\n\nTracklist:\n1. Like A G6 (Artistic Raw Remix) \n2. Like A G6 (Vato Gonzalez Remix) \n3. Like A G6 (Peppermint Private Rework)\n4. Like A G6 (Bare Remix) \n5. Like A G6 (Getter Remix) \n6.

Like A G6 (Origninal Song)\n\nI added ID3 tags using Sony Vegas Pro 10.0. I had the songs from a lot of different sources, so many contained advertisement from the website, or incorrect tags. \n\nPlease note that:\n- The Hardstyle remix is actually called D Mind - Blizzard, but I changed the ID3 tags so it would fit with the other torrents. \n- I do not know who exacly made track no. 6. Some say Roman, other say Afrojack... I just choosed Roman, but change the ID3 tags if you like.\n- Don't complain if I didn't add your favorite remix, but just add it yourself. I cannot smell what kind of remix you like :)\n\n\nIf you enjoy this torrent, please consider buying the music legally.\n\n\nslhaze 2011.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fb10a6b641daa938fb2abcef96c5f58761bf6a1","amp;dn":"Like+A+G6+%28Remix+Pack%29+%5BCompiled+by+slhaze%5D+-+320+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fb10a6b641daa938fb2abcef96c5f58761bf6a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,177,10,107,100,29,170,147,143,178,171,206,249,108,95,88,118,27,246,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
