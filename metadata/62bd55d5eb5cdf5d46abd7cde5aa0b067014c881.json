We apologise for this bug, but its a problem within L4D not the campaign.\n\n\nSERVER SIDE\n----------------------------\n\nExtract the CONTENTS of the folder to /left4dead. Pay attention that you extracted the CONTENTS of the DeadBeforeDawn folder directly into your left4dead folder. \n\nINCORRECT: left4dead/DeadBeforeDawn (There must be NO DeadBeforeDawn folder, only the files and folders inside the DeadBeforeDawn folder)\nCORRECT: /left4dead\n\nIf you install it to the addons folder on your server, it WILL NOT detect it. \n\nFor further support and questions, please visit www.L4DMods.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62bd55d5eb5cdf5d46abd7cde5aa0b067014c881","amp;dn":"Dead+Before+Dawn+-+A+Left+4+Dead+Campaign","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62bd55d5eb5cdf5d46abd7cde5aa0b067014c881","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,189,85,213,235,92,223,93,70,171,215,205,229,170,11,6,112,20,200,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
