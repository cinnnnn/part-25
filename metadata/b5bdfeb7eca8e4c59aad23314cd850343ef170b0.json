Monkey D. Luffy meets Shanks as a young boy living in East Blue. This is where he recruits most of his crew and, ultimately, where the adventure begins. This saga is made up of six story arcs.\n\nThe saga starts off with a flashback of Gol D. Roger's execution. Before he dies, he tells the crowds to go out and search for his treasure. This sparked the Golden Age of Pirates in which countless pirates raise their flags and set off to find One Piece.\n\nThe East Blue Saga focuses mainly on Luffy setting off for the Grand Line and gathering crewmates. During the saga, Luffy gains four comrades: Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji and earns a bounty of 30,000,000.\n\n\nUploaded By Mr_Boogj","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5bdfeb7eca8e4c59aad23314cd850343ef170b0","amp;dn":"One+Piece+English+Dub+Episode+1+-+61+East+Blue+Saga","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5bdfeb7eca8e4c59aad23314cd850343ef170b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,189,254,183,236,168,228,197,154,173,35,49,76,216,80,52,62,241,112,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
