First, the guy comes during Jeopardy, so I didn't get to record today's new episode, second, they tell me I dont get HD with the boxes they are providing and that the HD ones are $10/mth more. Then I learn (and this is the deal breaker) that my tv-tuner card in my computer cant change the channels anymore. So I've been researching an IR Blaster solution, but cant seem to find a feasible solution. I'm going to talk with them tomorrow, but I think cable is just not going to work...F**K COMCAST!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4cab6ff85252e396d2cf12fe7c5caa878549bac","amp;dn":"Wheel+of+Fortune.2014-05-15.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4cab6ff85252e396d2cf12fe7c5caa878549bac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,202,182,255,133,37,46,57,109,44,241,47,231,197,202,168,120,84,155,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
