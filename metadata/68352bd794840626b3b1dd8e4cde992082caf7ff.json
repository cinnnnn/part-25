Wadhwa., ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHigh Voltage EngineeringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nNew Age International | 2007 | ISBN: 8122418597, 812242323X | 312 pages | PDF \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHigh Voltage EngineeringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has been written for the undergraduate students in Electrical\nEngineering of Indian and foreign Universities as well as the practising electrical\nengineers.\nThe author developed interest in the field of High Voltage Engineering when he was a\nstudent at the Govt. Engineering College, Jabalpur. It used to be thrilling to observe large\nmetal spheres flashing over, corona phenomenon on a wire placed along the axis of a\ncylinder and then recording the corona loss, controlling the wave shapes of impulse voltages\netc.\nThe author has taught the subject at the Delhi College of Engineering for quite a number\nof years and while preparing lecture notes he referred to some of the books and journals\nand some literature from the internationally famed manufacturers of High Voltage\nequipments e.g. Haefely, Tettex etc. The lecture notes so prepared, thus, have a touch of\nboth the class room requirements and a practising engineerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s requirements.\nIn this edition, zeroth chapter on Electric Stress estimation and c ontrol has been added\nwhere in different methods viz. finite difference, finite element, charge simmulation method\nand surface charge simulation methods have been discussed per estimation of metric\nstresses in complex dielectric media and electrode configuration. a brief view of optimisation\nof electrode configuration is also given in this chapter.\nChapter 1 deals with the breakdown of gases, liquids, and solid materials. Even though it\nhas not been possible to explain the physical phenomenon associated with breakdown of\nthe materials, with accuracy and precisiveness, an attempt has been made to bring out\nsome of the theories advocated by researchers in this field in a simple lucid and organised\nway.\nChapters 2 and 3 discuss the generation of high d.c. and a.c. voltages and high impulse\nvoltages and currents. Some of the latest circuits have been discussed and rigorous mathematical\ntreatment of the circuit has been given to make the subject more interesting and\nto make the student understand the subject better.\nMeasurement of transient voltage and currents and high voltage and current require different\nskills and equipment as compared with common a.c. or d.c. voltages we normally\ncome across. Chapter 4 discusses various techniques and circuits for measurement of such\nquantities.\nChapter 5 deals into high voltage testing of electrical equipments like insulators, cables,\ntransformers, circuit breakers etc.\nThe measurements using high voltage Schering bridge, transformer ratio arm bridge and\npartial discharges yield information regarding the life expectancy and the long term stability\nor otherwise of the insulating materials. These techniques have been discussed elaborately\nin Chapter 6. These tests are very important both during design and operation of\nthe equipments.\nElectrical transients last for a very short duration but these play a very important role in\nthe insulation design of power system. Chapter 7 takes a view of various types of transients\nin power system and suggests classical and more modern statistical methods of\ncoordinating the insulation requirements of various equipments of the system and the\ndevices required for protection of these equipments.\nIn this edition of the book following articles have been added in chapter 1 of the book :\n(i) Breakdown in SF6 gas and Vacuum.\n(ii) Insulating materials used in power apparatus.\n(iii) Application of gases, liquid and solid insulating materials in different power apparatus.\nA suitable number of problems have been solved to help understand the relevant theory.\nAt the end, a large number of multiple choice questions have been added to help the\nreader to test himself. An extensive bibliography will help the reader to locate detailed\ninformation on various topics of his interest.\nThere are very few High Voltage Laboratories all over the world and the reader may not\nhave an opportunity to visit such a laboratory. Therefore, a few photoplates have been\nadded at suitable locations in the book to give a physical feel of various equipments in a\nwell equipped high voltage laboratory. The author feels that with the inclusion of\nphotoplates of high voltage equipments the student as well the practising engineers would\nbe greatly benefited.\nI wish to express my sincere thanks to M/s Emile Haefely &amp; Co. Ltd., Switzerland for\npermitting inclusion of photoplates in the book which has enhanced the utility of the book.\nI also wish my express my gratitude to my wife Usha, daughter Meenu and son Sandeep\nfor their patience and encouragement during the preparation of the book.\nAny constructive suggestion for the improvement of the book will be gratefully acknowledged.
