Maybe you like a different flavor!\nMaybe strawberry or butterscotch. What does this have to do with meeting women? EVERYTHING!\n\nYou see, all women are different, because no two people are the same. Yes, we\nhave the same instincts and the same sexual desires but our personal preferences\nare as different as grains of sand in the desert. (That\\'s why the saying goes that people are as unique as snowflakes)\n\nAll women don\\'t like the same food, they don\\'t like the same clothes! They don\\'t even like the same COLOR. So how can all women be interested in the same thing from a man? Think about it Some women like funny men. Some women like cocky men. Other women like gothic men, jocky men or men of a certain race, age or financial status.\n\nSo approaching women with the same techniques for starting conversation, or even the same techniques when it comes to the bedroom is a losing bet! But it\\'s been our best guess to date! It\\'s like playing the roulette wheel at the casino, and only placing your chips on either red or black.\n\nYeah, you win 50% of the time, and maybe you get her a little attracted to you! But it\\'s better than playing the numbers in the middle where your chances of success are slim and you\\'re likely to lose your shirt. It\\'s not the best way to play the game, however, it\\'s the SAFEST way. With the skills you have know, it\\'s the EASIEST way to win.\n\nWhat if there was a BETTER way?\n\nWhat if you could confidently bet all of your chips on a number in the middle? You win every time and youÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³d make a KILLING in profits. It\\'s the same way with women: When you know exactly what she likes; the deepest, darkest thoughts she thinks; and when you know what she secretly CRAVES from men, you can match her dating and sexual needs perfectly.\n\nYou\\'ll be the guy she\\'s been looking for. You\\'ll appear like a mind reader. You\\'ll seem like you know her better than she knows herself. Even if you just met her a few minutes ago.\n\nUntil now, you couldn\\'t get this information about her unless you stole her diary and read it. But recent insights into Female Psychology have cracked her mind right open, and you can peek into the Pandora\\'s Box to see her secret thoughts and read the contents. For example:\n\nDid you know that there are two ways women like to be approached? 50% of women respond well to a compliment while the other 50% of women wouldn\\'t DREAM of falling for a line like that. If the beautiful woman you just met likes the compliment you gave her, she\\'s start to connect with you and find her attractive.\n\nIf she doesn\\'t vibe with your line You\\'re dead where you stand. You won\\'t get another chance to win her heart, and she\\'s go back to whatever she was doing.\n\nYou can have THAT GIRL! You can save that conversation! With the new Pandora\\'s Box Techniques\nVin DiCarlo discovered, youÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ll know whether she\\'s a compliment girl or not before you ever approach her. (They\\'ll called Testers and Investors! And the strategies to meet each type are potent and powerful)\n\nDon\\'t miss out, though! Because she\\'ll eventually going to meet a guy who knows the Pandora\\'s Box system and wins her over.\n\nSize: 5.24GB 54 Files ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af8eae5a11bdabb880b459ed33d19cc9690c2e41","amp;dn":"Pandora%5C%27s+Box","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af8eae5a11bdabb880b459ed33d19cc9690c2e41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,142,174,90,17,189,171,184,128,180,89,237,51,209,156,201,105,12,46,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
