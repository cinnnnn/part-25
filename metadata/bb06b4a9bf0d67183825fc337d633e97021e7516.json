Now he reveals the jaw-dropping lengths Barack Obama and his allies in Hollywood, Washington, and Academia went to in order to transform a legion of iPod-listening, MTV-watching followers into a winning coalition that threatens to become a long-lasting political realignment.\n\n*Obama Zombies *uncovers the true, behind-the-scenes story of the methods and tactics the Obama campaign unleashed on youth culture. Through personal interviews and meticulous original research, Mattera explains why conservatismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future rests upon jolting the young masses from their slumber, yanking out their earphones, and sparking a countercultural conservative battle against the rise of the ignorant Left.\n\nThe lesson from 2008 is crystal clear: When true conservatives run away, Obama zombies come out to play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb06b4a9bf0d67183825fc337d633e97021e7516","amp;dn":"Obama+Zombies%3A+How+the+Obama+Machine+Brainwashed+My+Generation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb06b4a9bf0d67183825fc337d633e97021e7516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,6,180,169,191,13,103,24,56,37,252,51,125,99,62,151,2,30,117,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
