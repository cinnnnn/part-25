Fusing together pop melodies,\n     psychedelia, and art rock with an impish, punky\n     fury, the band cover more ground on their debut\n     album, Fuzzy Logic, than most indie bands do in\n     their entire career. However, the album works\n     better as a series of moments than as a\n     collection, mainly due to their overreaching\n     ambition. Each song floats by on irresistible,\n     catchy vocal harmonies, while the music\n     alternates between glitzy overdriven guitars and\n     sighing, sweeping keyboard, guitar, and string\n     backdrops. Over these lush sonic beds, lead\n     vocalist Gruff sings lyrics that are either\n     mystical, nonsensical, or bizarrely funny --\n     none of the songs make much literal sense, but\n     that doesn&amp;#039;t quite matter when the music is as\n     free-spirited as this. The songs may start\n     conventionally, but they&amp;#039;ll be undercut by wild\n     synthesizers and careening guitar solos, or\n     off-kilter vocal melodies. Taken as individual\n     moments -- as the singles &quot;God! Show Me Magic&quot;\n     (relatively straight-ahead punk-pop), &quot;Hometown\n     Unicorn&quot; (gorgeous psychedelia), and &quot;Something\n     4 the Weekend&quot; (which finds the middle ground\n     between the first two singles) prove -- the\n     music of Super Furry Animals is quite\n     intoxicating, but when assembled together, they\n     don&amp;#039;t sustain momentum. However, the individual\n     pleasures of each song become more apparent with\n     each listen and Fuzzy Logic suggests that the\n     group could blossom into something quite\n     distinctive and utterly unique within a few\n     albums.\n\n\n                                       ooo           ,,,           )))\n                                      (o o)         (o o)         (o o)\n     - Contact -------------------ooO--(_)--Ooo-ooO--(_)--Ooo-ooO--(_)--Ooo-\n\n\n      Contact us @ :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dbf01fed1bb249801ef6bd2950918f4508fed3c","amp;dn":"Super_Furry_Animals-Fuzzy_Logic-1996-CBM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dbf01fed1bb249801ef6bd2950918f4508fed3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,191,1,254,209,187,36,152,1,239,107,210,149,9,24,244,80,143,237,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
