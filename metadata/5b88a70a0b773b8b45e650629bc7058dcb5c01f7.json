ItÃ‚Â´s not your average horror movie, but rather a psychological horror movie with an eerie, creepy feeling to it. The movie is done on a shoe-string budget, but actually gets quite far with that. The movie has echoes of German Expressionism and the films of Luis Bunuel and has been said to have inspired movies like &amp;quot;Night of the\nLiving Dead&amp;quot; and PolanskiÃ‚Â´s &amp;quot;Repulsion&amp;quot;.\n\nI can really recommend this one!!\n\nSwedish subs are included.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055830/\n\nIMDb rating: 7.0\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b88a70a0b773b8b45e650629bc7058dcb5c01f7","amp;dn":"Carnival+of+Souls+1962+%5BCiN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b88a70a0b773b8b45e650629bc7058dcb5c01f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,136,167,10,11,119,59,139,69,230,80,98,155,199,5,141,203,92,1,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
