Physics is emphasised over mathematical rigour, making the material accessible to students with no previous knowledge of elementary particles. Important experiments and the theory linked to them are highlighted, helping students appreciate how key ideas were developed. The chapter on neutrino physics has been completely revised, and the final chapter summarises the limits of the standard model and introduces students to what lies beyond. Over 250 problems, including sixty that are new to this edition, encourage students to apply the theory themselves. Partial solutions to selected problems appear in the book, with full solutions and slides of all figures available at www.cambridge.org/9781107050402","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e468882a54a951d40e22d1d21e229e3c4765b9c","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Elementary+Particle+Physics%2C+2nd+Edition+%5B2014%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e468882a54a951d40e22d1d21e229e3c4765b9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,70,136,130,165,74,149,29,64,226,45,29,33,226,41,227,196,118,91,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
