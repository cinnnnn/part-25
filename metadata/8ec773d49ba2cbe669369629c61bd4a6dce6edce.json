Nicknamed the Doomsday Killer, he's claimed six victims in just two weeks, and the city is terrified. Even worse, the police are mystified: the victims have nothing in common, defying all profiling, and all that connects them is that each received a sick postcard in the mail before they died - a postcard that announced their date of death.\n\nIn desperation, the FBI assigns the case to maverick agent Will Piper, once the most accomplished expert on serial-killing in the bureau's history, but now on a dissolute spiral to retirement. Battling his own demons, Will is soon drawn back into a world he both loves and hates, determined to catch the killer whatever it takes. But his search takes him in a direction he could never have predicted, uncovering a shocking secret that has been closely guarded for centuries.\n\nUnabridged length : 12hrs 46mins\nNarrated by Pete Bradbury\nAudio CD Rip\nmp3 @ 64kbps\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nVisit us for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n\n\n-----------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ec773d49ba2cbe669369629c61bd4a6dce6edce","amp;dn":"Library+of+the+Dead+by+Glenn+Cooper+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ec773d49ba2cbe669369629c61bd4a6dce6edce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,199,115,212,155,162,203,230,105,54,150,41,198,27,212,166,220,230,237,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
