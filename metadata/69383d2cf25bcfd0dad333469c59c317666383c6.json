She has never heard about Christians suffering for their faith in Christ. But when she travels to China for the first time with her dad, a photojournalist, Abbey quickly becomes caught up in a plot that involves her new Christian friends, a mysterious secret agent, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œillegalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Bibles, and the police! Desperate to undo the mess she inadvertently causes, Abbey finds herself on a daring mission and in the process mourns her own simplistic understanding. She vows to carry the message of the persecuted church to Christians back in America.\n\nSet in modern-day Beijing and filmed in location in China and Taiwan with scenes that include the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square and The Great Wall, this drama reveals not only the harsh realities of being a Christian in a restricted nation such as China, but also the all-too-common ignorance of Christians in the free world.\n\nThis powerful video is a great tool for your family, friends, Sunday school class, or anyone who needs to hear the truth about Christian persecution.\n\nRuntime: 31 min\nLanguage: English (No-Subtitles)\nYear: 2005\nMy Rating: 9.5/10\nQuality: 9.0/10 \n\nIf financially possible, please buy this CD/DVD to keep Christian films in business. If Christians won't buy Christian films then who will?\n\nPlease seed. Let each one of us who call ourself Christians seed 2-3 movies each. So that these movies may become a blessing to all those who are hungry for God's word &amp; grace. May Jesus bless all those who are seeding the christian torrents.\n\n&quot;Don't ask me what Christ can do for you! \nHe has done all he could. \nTell me what you can do for Christ?&quot;\n\nUploaded by Indian Christian\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69383d2cf25bcfd0dad333469c59c317666383c6","amp;dn":"Agent+Abbey+%28Christian+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69383d2cf25bcfd0dad333469c59c317666383c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,56,61,44,242,91,207,208,218,211,51,70,156,89,195,23,102,99,131,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
