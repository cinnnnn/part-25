Breathtaking music to say the least.\n\nAbout half of this torrent was also stolen from a previous upload titled &quot;game music&quot;. The rest of the stuff was downloaded from various torrents or scavenged from the web (mostly Fileplanet, which took me a looooong time. Their cue-system really sucks). I should perhaps add that IÃ‚Â´m uncertain about the &quot;Might and magic &quot;- soundtrack. I found it on some website and it said it was from Heroes 2. However, I donÃ‚Â´t remember the music from Heroes 2 sounding like that, so perhaps itÃ‚Â´s from another game in the might and magic-franchise. The same goes for &quot;Warhammer&quot;. CouldnÃ‚Â´t figure out exactly what game it was from. If you figure it out, feel free to send me an email.\nIf you only want a specific soundtrack you can prioritize individual files in some torrent-programs such as Bitcomet, however, it would be best for everyone if you downloaded the whole thing and made sure to seed it properly.\n\nOh, and that brings us to the most important thing: remember to seed people. An upload ratio of at least 1,5 is not asking too much. Keep that in mind and perhaps we can keep this torrent alive for a good while. DonÃ‚Â´t forget to check out the &quot;Other&quot; folder where IÃ‚Â´ve put the great themes from Far Cry, Quake 2, Cyberstorm and more. Hell, now IÃ‚Â´m beginning to sound like a damn salesman, so IÃ‚Â´ll stop there...\n\nSend feedback, legal threats or your credit-card number (:p) to: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;95f9f4e2f0cafff0f1fcd5fdfae1f8f4fcf9bbf6faf8&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nHave fun!.\n\n/Threedots \n\nSoundtracks included are: \n  Freelancer                       \n  Giants                           \n  Ground Control   \n  Halo Combat Evolved\n  Halo 2            \n  Hitman                        \n  Icewind Dale Soundtrack       \n  Jade Empire\n  Medal of Honor Allied Assault \n  Medieval: Total War            \n  Might and Magic ?
