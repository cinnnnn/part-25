Her signature song was &quot;I Wanna Be Loved By You.&quot; Kane's voice and appearance were a likely source for Fleischer Studios animator Grim Natwick when creating Betty Boop, although It-girl Clara Bow is another possible influence.\n            Kane's career break came in 1927, when she appeared in a musical called &quot;A Night in Spain&quot;. It ran from May 3, 1927 through Nov 12, 1927 for a total of 174 performances, at the 44th Street Theatre in NYC. Subsequently, Paul Ash, a band conductor, put her name forward for a performance at New York's Paramount Theater. Kane's first performance at the Paramount Theater in Times Square proved to be her career's launching point. She was singing &quot;That's My Weakness Now,&quot; when she interpolated the scat lyrics Ã¢â‚¬Å“boop-boop-a-doop.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This resonated with the flapper culture, and four days later, Helen KaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name went up in lights.\n           Oscar HammersteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1928 show &quot;Good Boy&quot;, was where she first introduced the hit &quot;I Wanna Be Loved by You.&quot; Then it was back to the Palace, as a headliner for $5,000 a week. She rejoined her friends from vaudeville, The Three X Sisters (formerly The Hamilton Sisters and Fordyce) for one night. In a 1935 live stage performance, she harmonized with their unique banter to a novelty tune, &quot;The Preacher and the Bear.&quot;\n           Kane had excellent diction, intonation and timing, learned during her apprenticeship in vaudeville. Her songs have a strong word focus, and capitalize on her coquettish voice. She blended several fashionable styles of the late 1920s. These included scat singing, a kind of vocal improvisation, and also blending singing and speech. Sprechgesang (&quot;speech-song&quot;) was fashionable at this time in Germany's Weimar Republic in both nightclubs and in serious music.\n           Kane recorded 22 songs between 1928 and 1930. After 1930 and up to 1951, she recorded four sides for Columbia in addition to the &quot;Three Little Words&quot; soundtrack single recording of &quot;I Wanna Be Loved by You.&quot; She also recorded four songs that comprise a 1954 MGM 45Ep entitled, &quot;The Boop Boop a Doop Girl.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05.02  THE ROARING TWENTIES  - &quot;THE JAZZ AGE &quot; \n\n          Roaring Twenties is a phrase used to describe the 1920s, principally in North America, that emphasizes the period's social, artistic, and cultural dynamism.It was the age of prohibition, it was the age of prosperity, and it was the age of downfall. It was the decade of bath tub gin, the model T, the $5 work day, the first transatlantic flight, and the movie.  At the same time, amusement, fun and lightness were cultivated in jazz and dancing, in defiance of the horrors of World War I, which remained present in people's minds. In music, the three sounds were jazz, jazz, and jazz. The period is also often called &quot;The Jazz Age&quot;. \n\n\nSOPHIE TUCKER  -  Some of These Days   (1911)\nMARION HARRIS  -  AFTER YOU'VE  GONE  (1918)\nSOPHIE TUCKER  -  THE LAST OF THE RED HOT MAMAS  (1926)\nMILTON AGER &amp; JACK YALLEN -  AIN'T SHE SWEET  (1928)\nMILTON AGER &amp; JACK YALLEN -  I Ain't Got Nobody Much (and Nobody Cares for Me)  (1928)\nEDYTHE FLYNN - IS SHE MY MY GIRL FRIEND (How de-ow-dow)  (1928)   \nHELEN KANE  -  Don't Be Like That (1928) \nETHEL WATERS  -  Am I Blue?
