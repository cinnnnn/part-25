That year they performed over 100 shows including three tours throughout the UK and a tour of Eastern Europe.\n\nIn 2003 they released a second mini album - I'm Without Sleep... In This Desert of Concrete - on Household Name Records, supporting that release by touring Europe. They also conducted a 5 week tour with US ska-core band LeftÃƒÂ¶ver Crack that year.\n\nThe band also support animal rights campaigns and in 2004 donated &quot;I can smell freedom&quot; to a benefit CD for the Southern Animal Rights Coalition, &quot;Until Every Cage Is Empty&quot;.[1] On their debut album, the song &quot;Chili Con Tofu&quot;, a vegan food recipe,[2] questions the ideology that animals feel people don't think, which will continue so long as people think that animals are incapable of suffering. Kelly Kemp from No Comply said she had been influenced by the band whose members are nearly all vegan, and chose to change her diet after talking to them.[3]\n\nThe record label Household Name lists the band as having lasted until 2005.[4] In early 2006 they announced that Dani, their bassist, had left the band and that they are currently seeking a new bassist. This has halted production of their forthcoming album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52f02daa83f4075bcdfa4cd2a90ace41cd7cc62d","amp;dn":"Antimaniax+-+I%27m+Without+Sleep...+In+This+Desert+Of+Concrete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52f02daa83f4075bcdfa4cd2a90ace41cd7cc62d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,240,45,170,131,244,7,91,205,250,76,210,169,10,206,65,205,124,198,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
