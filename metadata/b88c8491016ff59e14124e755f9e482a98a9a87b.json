The story begins with minor league smuggling scams between Canada and the Caribbean that soon escalate to multi-ton shipments of grass and hash from the Caribbean and the Middle East. All goes well for a time, but as the stakes grow higher, inevitable setbacks occur. Drug-runners, police, jealous friends, and rival gangs all contribute to this extraordinary story of a young man who became involved at the highest levels of the drug trade and lived to tell about it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b88c8491016ff59e14124e755f9e482a98a9a87b","amp;dn":"Brown_Jay_Carter-Smugglers_Blues__The_Saga_of_a_Marijuana_Import","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b88c8491016ff59e14124e755f9e482a98a9a87b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,140,132,145,1,111,245,158,20,18,78,117,95,158,72,42,152,169,168,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
