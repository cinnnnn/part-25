Originally, the BR 628 were ordered to replace the older &quot;Railbuses&quot; Class 795, 798 and 515.\n\nThe development of the BR 628 can be divided in several stages. The seond version of this class, the BR628-2, was an extended version of the previous two versions.\nBefore the diesel multiple units became widespread, a number of short-term requirements from the future production Class 628.2 units were integrated, including a 1st class open compartment, better ventilation and a dividing wall between the driver's cab and the passenger compartment. Externally the front and back were more angled, the triple headlamp was moved down and a train destination display added in order to improve the vehicle's appearance and to keep passengers better informed. In all, 150 of these units were procured between 1986 and 1989. At the Kiel locomotive depot several of these railcars were driver for a while at up to 140 km/h, but because this seriously increased wear and tear, these express duties were soon terminated again. The Class 628.2 with the DB's Regionalbahn in Schleswig-Holstein was given a redesign with new seats, new interior decor, wheelchair ramps etc. Several years before, a Karlsruhe 628.2 had also been given a fundamental modernisation of its interior.\n\nThe experience with the BR 628-2 lead to an extended version, the BR 628-4 which were more powerfull and longer.\n\nThe Class 628-2 can be operated in a maximum of four pairs and has a maximum speed of 120 kilometre per hour. The weight of a carriage is around 42 tons.\n\n \n\nIncludes\n\nThis package contains:\n\nDiesel Multiple Unit (DMU) BR 628-2\nRealistic sound effects (recorded from the real DMU).
