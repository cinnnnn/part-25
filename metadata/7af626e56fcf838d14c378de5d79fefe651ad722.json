This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey tells about a 45 RPM single that was selling for $10 a copy in 1973! That recording is in this countdown.\n\nA listener asks, &quot;If Roberta Flack's record 'Killing Me Softly' made Record-Of-The-Year that would mean she had Record-Of-The-Year two years in a row. Has this ever happened before?&quot;\n\nOne singer-songwriter in the countdown named himself after a dog, to save his real name for when he made it big. Casey tells who.\n\nThere is one song in the countdown that the BBC refused to play, causing that song not to be released in the UK.\n\nFormed in 1965, Pink Floyd is on the chart with their first top 40 hit, &quot;Money.&quot;\n\nOne singer in the coundown got her big break singing in a club to an audience of nearly naked men.\n\nOne song in the countdown was first a hit in 1962. The singer learned he had made a comeback while he was earning a living driving a cab.\n\nOne song in the countdown tells of the buring down of the studio the song was about to be recorded in. (I know that doesn't make sense but that's what Casey says.)\n\n40: My Love - Paul McCartney and Wings\n39: The Hurt - Cat Stevens\n38: Right Place, Wrong Time - Dr. John\n37: Long Train Running - Doobie Brothers\n36: Young Love/A Million To One - Donny Osmond\n35: Soul Makossa - Manu Dibango\n34: Playground In My Mind - Clint Holmes\n33: Gypsy Man - War\n32: Misdemeanor - Foster Sylvers\n31: Give Me Love - George Harrison\n30: Are You Man Enough - Four Tops\n29: Behind Closed Doors - Charlie Rich\n28: Where Peaceful Waters Flow - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n27: How Can I Tell Her - Lobo\n26: Angel - Aretha Franklin\n25: So Very Hard To Go - Tower Of Power\n24: Say, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose - Dawn\n23: Natural High - Bloodstone\n22: Delta Dawn - Helen Reddy\n21: Kodachrome - Paul Simon\n20: If You Want Me To Stay - Sly &amp; The Family Stone\n19: Here I Am (Come And Take Me) - Al Green\n18: Money - Pink Floyd\n17: LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Get It On - Marvin Gaye\n16: Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy - Bette Midler\n15: Uneasy Rider - Charlie Daniels\n14: Get Down - Gilbert OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Sullivan\n13: I Believe In You (You Believe In Me) - Johnny Taylor\n12: Monster Mash - Bobby Ã¢â‚¬Å“BorisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Pickett &amp; The Crypt Kickers\n11: FeelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Stronger Everyday - Chicago\n10: Shambala - Three Dog Night\n9: Will It Go Round In Circles - Billy Preston\n8: Brother Louie - Stories\n7: Touch Me In The Morning - Diana Ross\n6: Diamond Girl - Seals &amp; Crofts\n5: Yesterday Once More - Carpenters\n4: Smoke On The Water - Deep Purple\n3: Live And Let Die - Wings\n2: Bad, Bad Leroy Brown - Jim Croce\n1: The Morning After - Maureen McGovern\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7af626e56fcf838d14c378de5d79fefe651ad722","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1973_August_4th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7af626e56fcf838d14c378de5d79fefe651ad722","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,246,38,229,111,207,131,141,20,195,120,222,93,121,254,254,101,26,215,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
