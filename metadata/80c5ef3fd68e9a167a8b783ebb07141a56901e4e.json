Meanwhile, the antagonist Gnasty Gnorc, who had been banished from the realms, becomes upset over comments the dragons make of him. Enraged, Gnasty Gnorc bombards the Dragon Realms with a magical spell, freezing the resident dragons into crystalline statues, and sends an army of Gnorcs in to steal the dragons&amp;#039; treasure.\n\nHowever, Gnasty somehow missed imprisoning the youngest dragon in the realm, Spyro. Realizing who is responsible for the disaster, Spyro sets out to free the realm&amp;#039;s dragons, recover their treasure hoard from the invading Gnorcs, and then confront and defeat Gnasty Gnorc himself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80c5ef3fd68e9a167a8b783ebb07141a56901e4e","amp;dn":"Spyro+the+Dragon+PAL+PSX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80c5ef3fd68e9a167a8b783ebb07141a56901e4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,197,239,63,214,142,154,22,122,139,120,62,187,7,20,26,86,144,30,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
