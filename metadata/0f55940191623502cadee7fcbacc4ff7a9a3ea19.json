This image gives way to another - a hanging corpse with violets stuffed in its mouth - which leads us into a maze of beguiling paths and wrong turnings, disappearances and revelations, unaccountable motives and cryptic deeds, as this compelling mystery swerves towards a starling vision at its centre.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f55940191623502cadee7fcbacc4ff7a9a3ea19","amp;dn":"A+Maggot+by+John+Fowles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f55940191623502cadee7fcbacc4ff7a9a3ea19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,85,148,1,145,98,53,2,202,222,231,252,186,204,79,247,169,163,234,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
