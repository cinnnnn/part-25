He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t own a gun yet, though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already connected with Abe. Soon heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll meet Julio and the Mikulski brothers. He runs afoul of some Dominicans, winds up at the East Side Marriott the night Meir Kahane is shot, gets on the bad side of some Arabs, starts a hot affair, and disrupts the smuggling of preteen sex slaves. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just Book One.\n\nepub,mobi and txt.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e05d2937affa870556e4688db40c50e3086f038e","amp;dn":"Cold+City+%28A+Repairman+Jack+Novel%29+By+F.+Paul+Wilson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e05d2937affa870556e4688db40c50e3086f038e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,93,41,55,175,250,135,5,86,228,104,141,180,12,80,227,8,111,3,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
