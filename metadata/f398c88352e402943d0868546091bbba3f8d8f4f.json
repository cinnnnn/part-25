In his first cookbook, Ayers shares recipes that fed the young minds at Google for more than six years as well as tips on eating, shopping and cooking smart. Ayers isn't telling readers anything new, but his clear and concise recipes are inspiring. The Smart Pantry section includes lists of Ayers favorite vinegars, oils and grains, and includes creative recipes for homemade condiments like Chutney-Yogurt Crust for fish, Roasted Jalapeno Ketchup, and Flavor Cubes, such as one made with carrot juice, eggplant and garlic puree frozen in ice trays and used to add quick flavor to soups or sauces.\n\n\nThe Smart Recipes section offers such original recipes as a Jade Smoothie, made with cucumber, apple cider and lemon sorbet, and Dragon Breath Noodles, with peanut butter, ginger and honey.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f398c88352e402943d0868546091bbba3f8d8f4f","amp;dn":"Food+2.0+Secrets+from+the+Chef+Who+Fed+Google","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f398c88352e402943d0868546091bbba3f8d8f4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,152,200,131,82,228,2,148,61,8,104,84,96,145,187,186,63,141,143,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
