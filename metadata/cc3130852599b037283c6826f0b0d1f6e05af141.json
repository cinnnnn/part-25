I need to improve it by resonating the tone in my chest. I have been trying to play the guitar again. I have gotten some of the piano back, but the guitar is frustrating. My hands naturally find the chords on the piano. And I have not figured out how to get my hands to work on the guitar again. I fight my hands to move to the chords instead of letting them go by themselves. It is so frustrating. I can barely get myself to pick up the guitar. And I still have the saxophone in the corner. And my trumpet. It is frustrating. Sometime ago I set all of my memories aside and it is frustrating trying to get back my music while not knowing what to do to get it back.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc3130852599b037283c6826f0b0d1f6e05af141","amp;dn":"Theme+Song+For+Jaws.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc3130852599b037283c6826f0b0d1f6e05af141","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,49,48,133,37,153,176,55,40,60,104,38,240,176,209,246,224,90,241,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
