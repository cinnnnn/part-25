While Through the Deep, Dark Valley is about the protagonistâ€™s past, Dear Wormwood is about the characterâ€™s future. The duo explains, â€œThis album is a collection of letters, all written by a single protagonist and addressed to a single recipient, a conversation to which the listener is an observer as a relationship gone wrong reaches its breaking point â€“ the words and music are at times affectionate and bittersweet \r\nat others resigned and resolute.â€ All songs written by Maggie and Tyler Heath, with the exception of Danse Macabre, written by Camille Saint-Saens (Public Domain). Produced by Maggie and Tyler Heath. \r\nRating \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n1. Prelude \r\n2. Bitter Water 03:16 \r\n3. There Beneath \r\n4. In the Blue Hours of Morning \r\n5.
