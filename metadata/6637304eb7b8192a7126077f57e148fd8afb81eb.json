He begins by dissecting the script through rough thumbnails, evaluating the pros and cons of each. He then lays out the two pages, discussing the importance of storytelling, character placement and readability in a sequential comic book layout. Next, Alvin shows how to prepare the layouts for light-boxing and sets up the final pages. He completes the demonstration discussing his pencilling techniques as he finishes the pencils with his own unique anime/manga influenced style.
