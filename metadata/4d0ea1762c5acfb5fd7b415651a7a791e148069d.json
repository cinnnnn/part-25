Using comic dexterity to hint at the era's underlying distemper, Michael Winner (yes, that Michael Winner) divines magic from Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement's restless script. A swinging caper so effervescent and breathless, you'll forgive even Ollie Reed's attempts at dancing.\n\n\n\nREUPLOADED        AS PROMISED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d0ea1762c5acfb5fd7b415651a7a791e148069d","amp;dn":"The+Jokers+++1967","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d0ea1762c5acfb5fd7b415651a7a791e148069d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,14,161,118,44,90,207,181,253,123,65,86,81,167,167,145,225,72,6,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
