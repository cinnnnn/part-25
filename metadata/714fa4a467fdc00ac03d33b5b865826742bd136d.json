Bax's rhapsodic genius and brilliant sense of orchestration eventually won him new audiences in the 1980s and 1990s. His First Symphony has been called the closest in character to his Celtic-inspired tone poems, and proved very popular at the time of its debut.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 256 kBits/s, directly from the disc.
