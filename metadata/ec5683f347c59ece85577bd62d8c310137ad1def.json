An explosive mixture of Metal and Rock n' Roll.\nIn the trunk you'll find their two previous albums released in 2005 (Headcharger) and 2007 (Watch the Sun).\nAt the wheel : 5 guys from Normandy who like to put the pedal to the floor like Every time I Die (The invention of solitude) as much as the Lynyrd Skynyrd southern rock vibes (Harvey Keitel's syndrome).\nAnd if that high-powered racing car switches to a dark lament that Alice In Chains wouldn't disown(The end starts here), it's only to take off like a shot while a lively harmonica tune is coming out from their open windows (Would you?).\nWith 300 shows behind them, Headcharger is charging French cities to perform shows as tuned as a stunning V8 with a rhythm section that has been given too much fuel, guitars full of bite and vocals both steady and rough.\nWith a mastering by Alan Douches (Sepultura, Fat Boy Slim, ...) and the XIII Bis/Sony stable (MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e, Fiction Plane,...) backing them.\n2005 - Self Titled\nimage\n2007 - Watch the Sun\nimage\n\n\n\n\nThe beginning of the 1st track of the 1st album may be a bit too crunchy, because my cd is really old and spent a lot of time outside his box, partying with friends !\nGenre: Heavy\nSubgenre: French stoner / rock / metal\nBitrate: 320 k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec5683f347c59ece85577bd62d8c310137ad1def","amp;dn":"+Headcharger-2005-2007+2+albums+mp3+320k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec5683f347c59ece85577bd62d8c310137ad1def","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,86,131,243,71,197,158,206,133,87,123,214,45,140,49,1,55,173,29,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
