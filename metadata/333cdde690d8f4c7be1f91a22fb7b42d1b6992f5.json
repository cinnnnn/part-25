For seven days I will post 1 Stossel episode. Ending next week on Thursday with the new episode. If I've counted right this will catch us up. There should be more episodes but Stossel has skipped a few weeks over the last couple months. \n\n\nSCHEDULE:\n---------\nFriday - Combating Terror\nSaturday - They're Coming To America\nSunday - Breaking... News?\nMonday - Big Brother\nTuesday - Crapitalism (Higher quality copy.)\nWednesday - Let Us Experiment\nThursday - Title yet to be announced.\n\n\nSTOSSEL'S TAKE\n--------------\nBIG BROTHER IS WATCHING: The phrase &quot;Big Brother&quot; comes from George Orwell's novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four,&quot;where government watches everyone constantly. Is that America today? Yes, say Matt Kibbe of FreedomWorks andJenny Beth Martin of Tea Party Patriots.\n\nMONEY MANIPULATION: Steve Forbes, Editor-In-Chief of Forbes Magazine, says government controls us by manipulating our money: &quot;weak money always means a stronger government.&quot;\n\nFREEDOM DEMOGRAPHICS: Sadly, Emily Ekins of Reason Foundation says millennials prefer larger government. But the good news is: when you ask them if they prefer larger government and higher taxes, they say no. Also, 58% of young people think government agencies generally abuse their power, and 63% say they don't trust government regulators.\n\nTHE NANNY STATE: The maker of the movie, Freedom from Choice, Tim Delmastro says &quot;most people would actually prefer freedom from making important decisions in their lives&quot; over the freedom to choose.\n\nEXECUTIVE POWER: President Obama uses executive power when congress doesn't do what he wants. But he doesn't do it more often that other presidents have. Obama issued 182 executive orders so far, but George W. Bush issued 290, and President Eisenhower, 480. Attorneys Tim and Christina Sandefur say it's not the number, but the content of these orders.\n\nWAR ON THE MIDDLE CLASS: The middle class is doing pretty well by historical standards: their average disposable household income has increased 40% since 1979. But radio host Wayne Allyn Root disagrees. I argue with him about whether or not the middle class is being &quot;murdered.&quot;\n\nMY TAKE: Lots of libertarians love Vegas: there's no income tax, gambling and sex work is legal, and people are free to carry concealed weapons. But Nevada is among the worst states when it comes to government colluding with business. Casino magnates like Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn fund ads that try to kill online gambling because it will compete with their casinos. Even though libertarians think of government as Big Brother, let's not forget that our friends in business often push government to limit competition.\n\n\nINFO:\n-----\nI ripped this using some cheap Diamond dongle. Ripped using EZ Ripper to their &quot;DVD standard&quot;. Cut into parts to remove commercials using AVIDemux and then joined those files. Using that same tool I then convert using MPEG4 AVC (x264) &amp; AAC (Faac) with a file limitation of 350mb, remove the black bars, and resize to 720x404.\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : J:MediaBrianTelevisionStosselStossel Season 05Stossel.2014.07.17.Big.Brother.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4 \nFormat : MPEG-4 \nFormat profile : Base Media \nCodec ID : isom \nFile size : 351 MiB \nDuration : 41mn 5s \nOverall bit rate : 1 193 Kbps \nWriting application : Lavf54.63.104 \n\nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;82caebe5eac2ceb1acb2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames \nCodec ID : avc1 \nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding \nDuration : 41mn 4s \nBit rate : 1 054 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 404 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Variable \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps \nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.121 \nStream size : 310 MiB (88%) \nWriting library : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912 \nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1054 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00 \n\nAudio \nID : 2 \nFormat : AAC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec \nFormat profile : LC \nCodec ID : 40 \nDuration : 41mn 5s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 37.6 MiB (11%) \nLanguage : unk \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:333cdde690d8f4c7be1f91a22fb7b42d1b6992f5","amp;dn":"Stossel.2014.07.17.Big.Brother.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"333cdde690d8f4c7be1f91a22fb7b42d1b6992f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,60,221,230,144,216,244,199,190,31,145,162,47,183,180,45,27,105,146,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
