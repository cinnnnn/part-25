If you drop a file on it, it'll build a nice preview page around it, upload both to your Dropbox, then copy the public preview link to your clipboard. If you drop a folder on it, the folder will be zipped up before uploading.\n\nNews: \n[NEW] Actual preview images for your uploaded files. That means prettier preview pages with less fugly icons! (See below.)\n[NEW] If you're brave, you can now subscribe to beta releases. Check your preferences and make sure to read the related blog post.\n[NEW] Should the app crash for some reason, you'll have the option to send me an automated crash report at the next start. I'd really appreciate if you'd use that feature! \n[FIX] Fixed problems with stalled uploads. (Servus will now retry to upload failed chunks for a few times before giving up.)\n[FIX] Adjusted hints text to reflect the changed submenus in the last release.\n[CHG] Updated icons in Preferences.\n[CHG] Updated the Dropbox SDK to 1.3.3.\n[CHG] Cleaned up log messages. It's still incredibly verbose, that'll be changed in one of the next releases.\n[CHG] Minor text changes here and there.\n\n[k'd] By LfsCrew \nBuon Divertimento! ;D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e74298f448c3aa6876fef35a8aa071fcc309528","amp;dn":"Servus+V1.3.621+%5Bk%27d%5D+By+LfsCrew.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e74298f448c3aa6876fef35a8aa071fcc309528","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,116,41,143,68,140,58,166,135,111,239,53,168,170,7,31,204,48,149,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
