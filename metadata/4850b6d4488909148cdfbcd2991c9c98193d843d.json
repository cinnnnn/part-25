To speed up the process, they secretly take a chance and add human DNA to the experiment. What they get is a new organism which Clive wants to destroy, but Elsa convinces him to let it live a little longer. As the creature grows bigger, you begin to see a new animal species. The creature looks like a human female, but it has many features of several animals. The creature has wings, a stinger, can breathe under water, and can communicate with Elsa. They begin to bond with the creature and name her Dren (Delphine Chaneac). Their little experiment has gotten out of hand, and it could be the end to their careers if it got out that they created an animal/human hybrid. They move Dren to Elsa's farm in the country where Dren continues to transform into something stronger. Clive and Elsa finally learn the reason why they shouldn't play with Mother Nature. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy) \n\n\n\nh*t*t*p*://*i48*.*tinypic*.*com*/2r4phl5.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4850b6d4488909148cdfbcd2991c9c98193d843d","amp;dn":"Splice.2010.Cam.XviD.UNDEAD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4850b6d4488909148cdfbcd2991c9c98193d843d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,80,182,212,72,137,9,20,140,223,188,210,153,28,156,152,25,61,132,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
