It informs Allah&quot;s commands. We learn the good morals which He is pleased with, the attitudes which deserve punishment, all the facts pertaining to the life of this world and the hereafter, all types of human characters we may encounter, fear of Allah, love of Allah, in short everything we need, from the Quran. This book, in which Allah&quot;s words are written, describes everything for which we look for an answer. Yet, some people avoid practising, even learning this book which would bring them to life, from &quot;the darkness to the light&quot;. However, Allah's commands in the Qur'an show the only way to salvation for all humanity, both in this world and in the hereafter.\nIt is necessary for a Muslim who has realised the importance of the Quran to have a good knowledge of the Quran in order to serve Allah as due and to live all his life according to the Quran. This book has been prepared to enhance the Quranic knowledge of those who aim to honour Allah with the honour that is due to Him, to fulfil their religious duties perfectly as His servants, and to attain His consent, mercy and Paradise.\n\nUploader&quot;s NOTE:  Inshallah A Huge Amount Of Haroon Yahya&quot;s Books Will Be Uploaded.\nThanks\n\nSpecial Thanks From: KW And JNF For Seeding And Helping","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2958596a4ed6c6a3fe69805c76b2cc8ce16a5205","amp;dn":"General+Knowledge+From+The+Quran","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2958596a4ed6c6a3fe69805c76b2cc8ce16a5205","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,88,89,106,78,214,198,163,254,105,128,92,118,178,204,140,225,106,82,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
