In either case, Moby was one of the most important dance music figures of the early '90s, helping bring the music to a mainstream audience both in England and in America. Moby fused rapid disco beats with heavy distorted guitars, punk rhythms, and detailed productions that drew equally from pop, dance, and movie soundtracks. Not only did his music differ from both the cool surface textures of ambient music and the hedonistic world of house music, but so did his lifestyle; Moby was famous for his devout radical Christian beliefs, as well as his environmental and vegan activism. &quot;Go&quot; became a British Top Ten hit in 1991, establishing him as one of the premier techno producers. By the time he came to the attention of American record critics with 1995's Everything Is Wrong, his following from the early '90s had begun to erode, particularly in Britain. Nevertheless, he remained one of the most recognizable figures within techno; after he abandoned the music for guitar rock with 1996's Animal Rights, he returned to a heavy electronic base with 1997's I Like to Score and 1999's Play, the latter of which made him a genuine breakout pop star. \n\n\nGenre................: Electronic\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Mp3 CBR 320 kbps (Insane)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c994e449edbbe519db16604cf142a3c9cfc8cd0","amp;dn":"Moby+-+Rio+%28Single%29+%282014%29+%7B320%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c994e449edbbe519db16604cf142a3c9cfc8cd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,153,78,68,158,219,190,81,157,177,102,4,207,20,42,60,156,252,140,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
