(ISTE, 2006).pdf\r\n\r\nNanophotonics is a comprehensive introduction to the emerging area concerned with controlling and shaping optical fields at a subwavelength scale. Photonic crystals and microcavities are extensively described, including non-linear optical effects.\r\nLocal-probe techniques are presented and are used to characterize plasmonic devices. The emerging fields of semiconductor nanocrystals and nanobiophotonics are also presented","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:462aa61dc0bf7dc137aa8e4d29c71443a47d44b8","amp;dn":"Nanophotonics+-+Herv%26eacute%3B+Rigneault+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"462aa61dc0bf7dc137aa8e4d29c71443a47d44b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,42,166,29,192,191,125,193,55,170,142,77,41,199,20,67,164,125,68,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
