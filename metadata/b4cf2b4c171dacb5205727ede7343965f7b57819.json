From there, we will explore some of the modeling features found in Softimage, and begin building the vehicle that will serve as our central project for the remainder of this tutorial.\n\nFrom there, we take you through the entire process of adding textures and materials to the vehicle, adding animated movement and animation controls, using the Interactive Creative Environment (ICE) to add particle and smoke dynamics, and finally we learn how to add lights, shadows, and output our final animated sequence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4cf2b4c171dacb5205727ede7343965f7b57819","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Introduction+to+Softimage+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4cf2b4c171dacb5205727ede7343965f7b57819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,207,43,76,23,29,172,181,32,87,39,237,231,52,57,101,247,181,120,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
