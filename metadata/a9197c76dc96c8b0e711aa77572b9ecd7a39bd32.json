I was going to call it &quot;Share This Book&quot; but to avoid confusion with these good folks -- http://freesouls.cc/essays/01-christopher-adams-share-this-book.html -- I'm going back to the original title, Pirate This Book: 95 Essays for the End of the World.\n\nI will release four more sections between now and December 21st, for a total of 5 containing 19 essays each.  I encourage everyone to share them with their friends, electronically or on paper.  Please feel free to print out individual pieces and do whatever you like with them.  Information does not belong to any one person, and I'd be a hypocrite if I refused to put my own stuff up for .torrent after downloading other people's.  So, here you are.  Seed if you like it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9197c76dc96c8b0e711aa77572b9ecd7a39bd32","amp;dn":"Pirate+This+Book%3A+95+Essays+for+the+End+of+the+World+%28Part+I%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9197c76dc96c8b0e711aa77572b9ecd7a39bd32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,25,124,118,220,150,200,176,231,17,170,119,87,43,158,205,122,57,189,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
