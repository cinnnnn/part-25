This is a duo album, but\nbecause of the overdubs you sometimes have more than two instruments playing\ntogether, sculpting sounds and themes that some would call &quot;post jazz&quot;, because\nit borrows from so many styles and techniques that the term jazz is no longer\ndescriptive. Hence the title &quot;Boca Negra&quot;, which means ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlack MouthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a term\ncoined in the Tenerife Canary Islands evoking the idea of an endless intake of\ninformation and also harks to the mouth of the volcano Tiede. In any case, it is\nagain a fantastic album. The two musicians do not shy away from complexity,\nincluding shifting time signatures, odd rhythms, and sound explorations, with\nclever use of electronics, although the entire albums is quite accessible and\nvery rhythmic.It all sounds simple, but it isn't. The greatest effect is created\non Ornette Coleman's &quot;Broken Shadows&quot;, on which Taylor plays drums and vibes\nsimultaneously, the theme of which I did not immediately recognize when I first\nlistened to it, but then I came to realise that the men broke down the theme\ninto different parts, with one musician stopping, and the other one taking over,\ncreating the real effect of broken shadows. The compositions combine atmosphere\nwith drive, with playfulness, with repetitive minimalism, with meditative\nmoments, with avant-garde adventure, ... the whole thing full of creative\ninventiveness, but above all, Mazurek's excellent playing of the cornet and Chad\nTaylor's excellent drumming. And a great production by Matt Lux.\nHighly recommended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7b9f5b814bee8e8b33acc56b24b87bedfdeb400","amp;dn":"Chicago+Underground+Duo+-+Boca+Negra+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7b9f5b814bee8e8b33acc56b24b87bedfdeb400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,185,245,184,20,190,232,232,179,58,204,86,178,75,135,190,223,222,180,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
