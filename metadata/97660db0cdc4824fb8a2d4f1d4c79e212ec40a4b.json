Set in a future where urbanites are segregated by strict curfews into Daytimers and Nighttimers, the narrative unfolds as an oral history comprising contradictory accounts from people who knew Buster. These include childhood friends horrified by the boyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s macabre behavior (getting snakes, scorpions and spiders to bite him and induce instant erections; repeatedly infecting himself with rabies), policemen and doctors who had dealings with the rabies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsuperspreaderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; and Party Crashers, thrill-seeking Nighttimers who turn city streets into demolition derby arenas. After liberally infecting his hometown peers with rabies, Buster hits the big city and takes up with the Party Crashers. A series of deaths lead to a police investigation of Buster (long-since known as &quot;Rant&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the sound children make while vomiting) that peaks just as Buster apparently commits suicide in a blaze of car-crash glory. This dark religious parable (thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even a resurrection) from the master of grotesque excess may not attract new readers, but it will delight old ones.

Critics agreed that Rant is vintage Palahniuk, a grim thriller ride filled with his signature black humor, withering social commentary, and stomach-churning details. Some grumbled, however, that the ideas in Rant have been recycled from previous novels, particularly Fight Club. They were also disappointed with the novelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lack of depth, distracting structure (a succession of hundreds of brief eyewitness testimonies), and underlying glorification of violence. The truth is that Palahniuk is an acquired taste. Readers either love him or leave him alone, and will judge Rant accordingly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97660db0cdc4824fb8a2d4f1d4c79e212ec40a4b","amp;dn":"Rant%3A+An+Oral+Biography+of+Buster+Casey+-+Chuck+Palahniuk+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97660db0cdc4824fb8a2d4f1d4c79e212ec40a4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,102,13,176,205,196,130,79,184,162,212,241,212,199,158,33,46,196,10,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
