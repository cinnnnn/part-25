This album was recorded live at CBGB's, and at a private party they played for some bloke.  You may be surprised to hear the massive crowd noise generated, as CBGB's is quite famously a small venue, but so legend has it, the crowd noise was lifted straight from the Kiss Alive album, which the album parodies throughout.  So I'm told anyway, I'm a Donut fan, I've got enough taste not to own anything by the painted clowns of Kiss.\n\nThis album contains the finest collection of tunes I own from the late '80s/early 90's.  Tommy Antona's sick, satirically sharp lyrics are squealed out perfectly, his voice soaring, reverberating on those high notes.  The guitars are both punky and psychedelic, giving the band a truly original sound.  The backing vocals create smooth pop harmonies, shedding some light upon the dark lyrical twists.  \nAs always, Donut don't do anything conventionally, the opening track, &quot;Green Meat Stew&quot; is a re-write of the opener from Donut comes Alive, the mandatory cover version is of The Beatles &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, the vocals replaced by lead trombone, &quot;I've got blisters on my lips&quot; comes the cry at the end.
