How those challenges may affect the coverage of global climate change presents its own set of questions, and the outcome for journalism ethics is as unpredictable as it is for climate change policies and for journalism itself. This article raises issues that will have to be sorted out over time if the public is to be kept well informed about the challenges, risks, and opportunities posed by climate change.\n\nKEY WORDS: Journalism Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Climate change Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· News media Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Global warming Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Journalism ethics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ee86220a712999aac63228ebe5ce115c4ad298c","amp;dn":"Journalism+Ethics+and+Climate+Change.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ee86220a712999aac63228ebe5ce115c4ad298c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,232,98,32,167,18,153,154,172,99,34,142,190,92,225,21,196,173,41,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
