It's a cleaner recording than the ESP release though also a little more distant. Don Cherry makes a fascinating contribution, however. Cherry, fresh from Ornette and Sonny Rollins, is more used to a dancing, glancing interplay with the saxophonist. So the music, while strong, is lighter in texture. Of course, this is still Albert Ayler's concept; he was a thoroughly original 20th-century artist who could enthrall and terrify in the same measure. &quot;Vibrations&quot; itself is like the universe shaking itself down, while &quot;Mothers&quot; strikes an overwhelming mournful note. As on Spiritual Unity, the neo-Calypso &quot;Ghosts,&quot; Ayler's most familar composition, gets two plays here--one short, one longer. \n\nTracklist:\n\n01 Ghosts (2:04)\n02  Children (6:50)\n03  Holy Spirit (8:29)\n04  Ghosts (7:58 )\n05  Vibrations (4:55)\n06  Mothers (7:06)\n\nPersonnel:\n\nAlbert Ayler - Tenor Saxophone\nDon Cherry -Ttrumpet\nGary Peacock - Bass\nSunny Murray - Drums\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab7b032ce4655aa51fcd8fbb326232d43d5ac3a","amp;dn":"Albert+Ayler+and+Don+Cherry+Vibrations%28jazz%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab7b032ce4655aa51fcd8fbb326232d43d5ac3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,183,176,50,206,70,85,170,81,252,216,251,179,38,35,45,67,213,172,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
