In every way, **â€¨A Most Dangerous Book is a most brilliant achievement.&quot;--Washington Post  \r\n\r\nWhen the Roman historian Tacitus wrote the Germania, a none-too-flattering little book about the ancient Germans, he could not have foreseen that centuries later the Nazis would extol it as &quot;a bible&quot; and vow to resurrect Germany on its grounds. But the Germania inspired--and polarized--readers long before the rise of the Third Reich. In this elegant and captivating history, Christopher B. Krebs, a professor of classics at Harvard University, traces the wide-ranging influence of the Germania, revealing how an ancient text rose to take its place among the most dangerous books in the world. 14 illustrations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2508b501f061e65094ef8416fabce12345aa0e4f","amp;dn":"A+Most+Dangerous+Book+-+Christopher+B.+Crebs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2508b501f061e65094ef8416fabce12345aa0e4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,8,181,1,240,97,230,80,148,239,132,22,250,188,225,35,69,170,14,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
