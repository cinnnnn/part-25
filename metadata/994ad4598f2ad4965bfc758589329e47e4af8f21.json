TPB choked on the actual torrent, maybe because the .torrent is over a meg, or that the torrent itself is 92GB/972Files, or maybe I didn't talk nice to it. Dunno. This torrent also contains a file list.\n\n\n\n*The main torrent includes these folders:\n\nArticles - (2 Harper's columns and 1 Dawkins interview)\n\nClips - (Clips from documentaries he was in and other short vids)\n\nC-SPAN - (All his C-SPAN appearances. I got all of them from c-spanvideo.org using rtmpdump so they are in the best quality available. \n\nDebates - (All the debates I could find)\n\nDiscussions an Interviews - (TV interviews and some panel discussions)\n\nDocumentaries - (Full documentaries he hosted or was a part of)\n\nNews Panels and Talkshows - (Firing Line, Real Time, Charlie Rose, etc. and his appearances on news shows)\n\nOther - (A few transcripts and the Penn and Teller episode he was in)\n\nRadio and Podcasts - (All his radio and podcast appearances I could find, in mp3 if I could find the source or mp4 from youtube)\n\nSolo Talks - ( His solo talks about religion, axis of evil, etc.)\n\nTributes and Discussions - (Clips from radio and tv of Carol Blue discussing his life and tributes from various shows)\n\nAll of the full video/audio files have a description .txt file to go with them which has a description and a date if I could find one. This way it will be easier for people to mirror them on youtube if they want.\n\n*Note: This is a mirror of CaNANDian's torrent on Kickass, all credit goes to them. I'm just spreading this great archive of the Hitch to TPB.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:994ad4598f2ad4965bfc758589329e47e4af8f21","amp;dn":"Christopher+Hitchens+Archive+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"994ad4598f2ad4965bfc758589329e47e4af8f21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,74,212,89,143,42,212,150,91,252,117,133,137,50,158,71,228,175,143,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
