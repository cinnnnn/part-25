Each episode follows one tank's story: the rebuild; the innovations that made each machine great, and the engineering flaws that proved fatal. Unique serial numbers lead us to re-trace each tank's forged-in-war history: discovering where it was made, the battles it fought and the often tragic end of its fighting career. Once the hard work is over, we see the machines sputter and roar to life.\n\nDirector : PJ Naworynski\nExecutive Producer for Military Channel : Peter Rees\nAn Ellis Vision Production with Viasat Explorer, UKTV, Canwest and Military Channel (2009)\n\n\nEpisode 2 : The Elephant\nOne of the largest heaviest tank destroyers ever built, the Elephant was brilliant on paper and terrifying to behold. But in 1943, the Germans sent it into battle without having ever tested it. Under fire, the massive monster turned out to be a sitting duck for courageous Soviet fighters who learned they could disable it with a simple Molotov cocktail.\n\nThe Elephant is possible the rarest surviving tank from World War 2. Only 90 were ever built and now only two are thought to exist. At the US Army Ordnance Museum, you will see a crack team restore a rusted beat up machine that has been left on the sidelines since 1944.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2133 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688x384\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.792:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 48:52.080\nNumber Of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 854,833,152 Bytes\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:457c9aa62c839e72e7bf56c743b5798deaa64747","amp;dn":"Military.Channel.Tank.Overhaul.Series2.2of4.The.Elephant.XviD.AC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"457c9aa62c839e72e7bf56c743b5798deaa64747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,124,154,166,44,131,158,114,231,191,86,199,67,181,121,141,234,166,71,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
