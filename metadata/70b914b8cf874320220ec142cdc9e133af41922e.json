We deem that the treatise in question is an adequate response to the challenge of BahaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢i ism to Islam and needs to be reprinted and widely published. \n\nThe book covers (1) the history of Babi ism and BahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢i ism and their basic tenets; (2) the true nature of the claims of Bab and BahaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢uallah; (3) a comparison between the Islamic and BahaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢i Sharias; and (4) the question why the QurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢an and Islamic Sharia are irreplaceable.\n\nBahaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢i ism inspite of its so called worldwide reputation remains an esoteric creed and a secret organization the true teachings of which, especially about the real nature of BahaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ullah's claim, are known only to the selected few so much so that its own followers are kept ignorant about these acts.\nHowever, an attractive and acceptable facade is erected around the nucleus of the teachings to attract and exploit the credulous common man. Moreover, as a consequence of the above, BahaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢i ism is very adept at disguising itself behind various masks to appeal to various religions and creeds.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFollowing is the location where Jesus is buried.\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Rozabal/@34.094209,74.816296,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x44fae1e270113ec6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Rozabal/@34.094209,74.816296,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x44fae1e270113ec6&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn Overview of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community:\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a dynamic, fast growing international revival movement within Islam. Founded in 1889, it spans over 206 countries with membership exceeding tens of millions. Its current headquarters are in the United Kingdom.\n\nAhmadiyya Muslim Community is the only Islamic organization to believe that the long-awaited Messiah has come in the person of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad(as) (1835-1908) of Qadian. Ahmad(as) claimed to be the metaphorical second coming of Jesus(as) of Nazareth and the divine guide, whose advent was foretold by the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad(sa).\n\nContact for more details:\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/contactus/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/contactus/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOfficial websites:\n        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRelated torrent:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11955517&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11955517&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11954461&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11954461&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11952981&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/11952981&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/1193102&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirateproxy.sx/torrent/1193102&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70b914b8cf874320220ec142cdc9e133af41922e","amp;dn":"The+Babi+and+Bahai+religions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70b914b8cf874320220ec142cdc9e133af41922e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,185,20,184,207,135,67,32,34,14,193,66,205,201,225,51,175,65,146,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
