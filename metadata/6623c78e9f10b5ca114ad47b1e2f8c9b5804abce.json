Taza promises his father that he will keep the tribe -- which Cochise united and ruled -- at peace. But Taza's brother wants the tribe to join with another bloodthirsty tribe, headed by Geronimo (Ian MacDonald), which is tangling with white settlers and other Indian tribes. Taza must battle his brother and try to keep his promise to his father. This film was originally shown in 3-D, and many of the battle scenes feature shots of warriors rushing headlong toward the screen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6623c78e9f10b5ca114ad47b1e2f8c9b5804abce","amp;dn":"Taza%2C+Douglas+Sirk%2C+1954","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6623c78e9f10b5ca114ad47b1e2f8c9b5804abce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,35,199,142,159,16,181,202,17,74,212,123,30,47,140,155,88,4,171,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
