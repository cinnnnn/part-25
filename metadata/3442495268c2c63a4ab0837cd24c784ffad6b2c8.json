Saddled with a recently expelled, faithless localÃ¢â‚¬â€œcop husband, a teenaged terror of a stepson, and the yappiest, most unhousebreakable Chihuahua in captivity, Nina needs a respite Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œ and the backyard makeover she's undertaking for her sister Maria and Nate, Maria's fiance, may do the trick.\n\nBut, of course, Nate vanishes mysteriously, and Nina's gardening magic inadvertently turns up a corpse. And with a thief on the prowl who's preying on the neighborhood elderly, a suspicious Pandora's Box of a package arriving on her doorstep, and yet another body inconveniently turning up, Nina's going to have to dig into her community's dirtiest little secrets to regain her peace and sanity Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œ if she can manage to stay alive long enough to enjoy it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3442495268c2c63a4ab0837cd24c784ffad6b2c8","amp;dn":"Trouble+in+Spades+%28A+Nina+Quinn+Mystery%2C+%232%29+-+Heather+Webber.ep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3442495268c2c63a4ab0837cd24c784ffad6b2c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,66,73,82,104,194,198,58,74,176,131,124,210,76,120,79,250,214,178,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
