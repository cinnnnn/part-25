Create as many encrypted vaults as you want, each with separate passwords. Then schedule automatic backups. You can even reformat USB sticks and external drives as encrypted Knox vaults - moving files between Macs has never been so simple and secure.\n\nKnox uses the Mac OS X encrypted disk images feature, the technology behind FileVault, to protect your data. This means that your vaults are encrypted by the U.S. Government's new Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with 256-bit or 128-bit key length. The AES algorithm is secure, but don't take our word for it: even the NSA has found its strength to be sufficient for protecting classified national security information. The implication? Your data will be safe whether it's a rogue kid or a rogue nation going after it.\n\nAnd because the encrypted disk images are supported as standard in Mac OS X, Knox vaults - including whole disks encrypted with Knox - can be opened even without Knox installed.\n\n What's New\n\n Version 2.1.13:\n   \n * Fixed additional rare crash animating menu bar icon.\n\n---\n\nThe keygen also have a keygenrator for 1Password: https://agilebits.com/onepassword/mac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd4fe6f14ef6bd700f39e2fd1f69b58cfb09946f","amp;dn":"Knox+-+2.1.13+%5BIntel%2FKG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd4fe6f14ef6bd700f39e2fd1f69b58cfb09946f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,79,230,241,78,246,189,112,15,57,226,253,31,105,181,140,251,9,148,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
