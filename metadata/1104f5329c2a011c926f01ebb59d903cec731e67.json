Keith A. Gordon, Blurt!\n\n&quot;...They meet through their humor as lyricists and their shared love of GOOD OLD-FASHIONED SWAMP-BRED GUITAR RIFFS, and as amply evidenced throughout this album, the result is AN INFECTIOUSLY GOOD TIME for all concerned.&quot; Ã‚Â­ BluegrassSpecial.com\n\n&quot;The musical approach is rustic, recalling hints of Dylan, the Band, Clapton, the Allman Brothers, and Little Feat.
