Leaving behind domesticity, his approaching forties, his inability to create, and his memories of his parents, he sets off to find calm in the comfortable silence of isolation. But when he puts himself in the hands of a shape-shifting driver full of Irish charm and dark whimsy, what ensues can only be termed a magical mystery tour.\r\n \r\nBeatlebone is a tour de force of language and literary imagination that marries the most improbable element to the most striking effect","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1316ea0de040213d03af38c7cce734b83aac850f","amp;dn":"Beatlebone+-+Kevin+Barry.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1316ea0de040213d03af38c7cce734b83aac850f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,22,234,13,224,64,33,61,3,175,56,199,204,231,52,184,58,172,133,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
