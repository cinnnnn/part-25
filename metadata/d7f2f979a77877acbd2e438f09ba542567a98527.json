Due to their uniquely crispy exterior and juicy interior, breaded fried foods, in particular, are popular among consumers. Unlike many books that have focused solely on the process of deep-fat frying and fried foods in general, Breaded Fried Foods is one of the first references to provide a coherent and concise overview of issues that are specific to breaded, or battered, fried foods.\n\nWith internationally recognized authors, including renowned expert Dr. Manjeet S. Chinnan, this comprehensive resource addresses groundbreaking advances in the reduction of fat uptake in fried foods, best practices for enhancing the quality of breaded fried foods, techniques for improving product crispness, and the impact of breading and batters on the quality of frying oil. The book also discusses new industry frying methods, preventive measures to reduce oil waste, and pre- and post-frying procedures to limit oil uptake.\n\nDeep-fat fried foods are universal with strong consumer appeal in countries worldwide. Filled with numerous graphs and photographic illustrations, Breaded Fried Foods encapsulates the most current industry research and technological advances in this ever-growing industry. \n\nHardcover: 184 pages\nPublisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (September 22, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0849314615\nISBN-13: 978-0849314612","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7f2f979a77877acbd2e438f09ba542567a98527","amp;dn":"Breaded+Fried+Foods%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7f2f979a77877acbd2e438f09ba542567a98527","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,242,249,121,167,120,119,172,189,46,67,143,9,186,84,37,103,169,133,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
