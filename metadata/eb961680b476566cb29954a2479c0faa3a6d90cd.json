The 9th Dimension\n\nThe Argentinian-Spanish producer Eric Mokotoff aka Quantica, settled down in his studio in Ibiza while mixing and mastering for others artists, Eric was also slowly cooking the 4th Quantica studio album...Now he is back to the party bringing us 'Drops of Light'.\n\nDrops of Light is a dynamic trip, starting from 'Eliptica' a prime example of upbeat psychedelic club to the funkiest open air vibes of 'Strange Report', bobbing drop by drop into 'Aural Exciter' a smart combination of psy roots with the uplifting proggy-psy trends, balanced with energized full-On tunes.\n\nIn the early 90's Eric was the guitar player of one of the most relevant Argentinian reggae bands, echoes of those times are reflected in the collaboration with one of the UK's biggest producer, Bill Halsey aka Cosmosis, a pioneer of the genre.\n\nAs well and as no less interesting mention to the track 'Hardware Interrupt' in collaboration with the Spanish talent Raul Jordan aka Psycho Abstract.\n\n5 years after the succesfull Quantica album debut, Drops of Light keep the identity of the quantica's basic ingredients. Deep atmospheres, pumping basslines, astounding percussion, psychedelics dialogues, swirling melodies and a funky fresh touch, resulting in 9 quality tracks.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb961680b476566cb29954a2479c0faa3a6d90cd","amp;dn":"Quantica+-+Drops+Of+Light+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb961680b476566cb29954a2479c0faa3a6d90cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,150,22,128,180,118,86,108,178,153,84,162,71,156,15,170,58,109,144,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
