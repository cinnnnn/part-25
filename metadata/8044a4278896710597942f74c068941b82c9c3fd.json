It is the eighth game in the Mega Man X series and the most recently released game in that series. It was first released in North America on December 7, 2004. The PS2 version, as well as a PC integration, were released in Japan and Europe the following year.\n\nThe plot of Mega Man X8 focuses on the abduction of a next-generation &quot;Reploid&quot; from the construction site of a space elevator, and the subsequent pursuit of his captors. During the course of game play the motivations of these captors comes into focus, and it is up to the heroes, led by Mega Man X, to stop them. The gameplay of Mega Man X8 is similar to the other games in the series, in which the player must complete a series of stages. Defeating their bosses will earn that player character its special weapon.\n\nAlthough Mega Man X8 uses 3D graphics like Mega Man X7, the development team chose not to opt for 3D gameplay. The game was met with a mixed critical reception.\n\nMega Man X8\n\nPublisher: Capcom\nDeveloper: Capcom\n\nMinimum System Requirements\n\nOS: Windows 98/ME/2000/XP\nProcessor: Pentium 3 @ 1 GHz or Equivalent\nMemory: 128 MB\nHard Drive: 1 GB Free\nVideo Memory: 64 MB\nSound Card: DirectX Compatible\nDirectX: 8.1\nKeyboard &amp; Mouse\nCD/DVD Rom Drive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8044a4278896710597942f74c068941b82c9c3fd","amp;dn":"Megaman+%28Rockman%29+X8+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8044a4278896710597942f74c068941b82c9c3fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,68,164,39,136,150,113,5,151,148,47,116,192,104,148,27,130,201,195,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
