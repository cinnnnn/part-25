Burnout Dominator is the sixth game in the Burnout series overall and retains the core gameplay of the series, as players race at top speeds through dozens of World Tour events testing &quot;reckless skill-based&quot; driving techniques. The versions for each platform do not interact with each other.\n\nThis is the only Burnout game that was not developed by Criterion Software,and the first Burnout game in the series since Burnout 2: Point of Impact to not feature the &quot;Crash Mode&quot;. At the time Dominator was being developed, Criterion was busy working on Burnout Paradise and was waiting to re-introduce the mode in a new form for the latter title. However, Criterion Software are listed as &quot;the makers of this game&quot; in the game manual and credited as developer on the official Electronic Arts site.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebe6b4e753a9681e7458c6d199d93323487705b6","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5DBurnout+Dominator+uploaded+by+Jeric0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebe6b4e753a9681e7458c6d199d93323487705b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,230,180,231,83,169,104,30,116,88,198,209,153,217,51,35,72,119,5,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
