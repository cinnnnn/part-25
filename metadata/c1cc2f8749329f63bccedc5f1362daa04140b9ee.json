Software installs and compatibility, hardware operation and more are managed by a complex database of codes and numbers. When something goes wrong it can seem impossible to diagnose and repair the problem, and harder still to prevent a recurrence or make the subtle changes and tweaks required to fix the problem. In this book weâ€™ll take you inside the workings of the Registry, and teach you how to repair, modify and clean it to keep your PCs running smoothly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1cc2f8749329f63bccedc5f1362daa04140b9ee","amp;dn":"Windows+Registry+Troubleshooting+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1cc2f8749329f63bccedc5f1362daa04140b9ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,204,47,135,73,50,159,99,188,206,220,95,19,98,218,160,65,64,185,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
