She gets hold of outtakes and censored footage and interviews the man's friends, ex-wife, and the filmmaker who made him a hero. A portrait of Birkut emerges: he believed in the workers' revolution, in building housing for all, and his very virtues were his undoing. Her hard-driving style and the content of the film unnerve her supervisor, who kills the project with the excuse she's over budget. Is there any way she can push the film to completion?\n\n\n(The film chronicles the fall from grace of a heroic Polish bricklayer, Mateusz Birkut (played by Jerzy RadziwiÃ…â€šowicz), who became the symbol of the worker in Nowa Huta, a new (real life) socialist city near KrakÃƒÂ³w. Agnieszka, played by Krystyna Janda in her first role, is a young filmmaker who is making her diploma film on Birkut, whose whereabouts seems to have been lost two decades later. The title refers to the propagandistic marble statues made in Birkut's image. It is somewhat of a surprise that Wajda would have been able to make such a film, sub silentio attacking the Socialist Realism of Nowa Huta, and presaged the loosening grip of the Soviets that came with the Solidarity Movement.)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a54c40dbadb0f2516b80fdffaae7f6f22290ec25","amp;dn":"%E5%A4%A7%E7%90%86%E7%9F%B3%E4%BA%BA%2FCzlowiek+z+marmuru%2FMan+of+Marble%281977%29audio%3ARUS+or+POL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a54c40dbadb0f2516b80fdffaae7f6f22290ec25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,76,64,219,173,176,242,81,107,128,253,255,170,231,246,242,34,144,236,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
