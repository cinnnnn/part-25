What's more, it doesn't require any special hack.\n\nAll you have to do is plug your iPhone or iPod Touch to the PC and launch the program Ã¢â‚¬â€œ no installation required. iFunBox will immediately read the contents of the device and display it in a double-pane interface, with the folder structure on the left side and the date stored in the selected folder on the right side.\n\nWith iFunBox you can easily transfer files between the iPhone or iPod and the computer, take advantage of the device's storage and use it as a portable USB disk, and make backup copies of all your music and video files. iFunBox also lets you convert and upload any image to the iPhone as wallpaper, but unfortunately this function requires jailbreak.\n\niFunBox lets you make the most of your iPhone or iPod Touch by providing you with a full featured file browser that helps transfer data between your Apple device and your computer.\n\n\niFunBox for Windows Version 2.6\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Import/Export music, video, photo and ringtone files\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Accelerated thumbnail preview in Camera Roll\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Optimized device connection 2x speed up\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Alert for failing to connect the device\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed crashing issue on errors\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc60b0ad527954e92e406a750af6fdc1fb4b9b43","amp;dn":"iFunBox+for+Windows+Version+2.6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc60b0ad527954e92e406a750af6fdc1fb4b9b43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,96,176,173,82,121,84,233,46,64,106,117,10,246,253,193,251,75,155,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
