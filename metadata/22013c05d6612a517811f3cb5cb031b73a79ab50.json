As of yet, the Remastered OST has yet to be released in any other format.\n\nEnjoy! Hopefully, there will be an official album release for Remastered (and by extension the NES game) soon, but this should suffice in the meantime!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22013c05d6612a517811f3cb5cb031b73a79ab50","amp;dn":"DuckTales+OSTs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22013c05d6612a517811f3cb5cb031b73a79ab50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,1,60,5,214,97,42,81,120,17,243,203,92,176,49,183,58,121,171,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
