It was deliberately designed to support, augment and in some cases replace existing solo violin libraries. Essentially this library takes over where normal multi-samples (ex. legato, sustains) can't perform. This is what 8Dio call deep phrase-sampling.\nStudio Solo Violin comes with a variety of phrase sculpting tools, including pitch-control, time-stretching / time-compression, sample offset (which allows you to &quot;scroll&quot; into any phrase and trigger any part of it), FX and convolution reverbs. The pitch-control is not affected by tempo, so by controlling pitch, time-stretching/compression and sample offset you can essentially adapt the phrase to match the pitch and tempo of your composition.\nIn addition 8Dio added a variety of other features. You can control the dynamics, attack and releases of each sample. You can control the EQ (high, mids and lows), Gates and Filter. You can also control a variety of FX directly from the keyboard, including bit-resolution, delay, reverb, distortion, rotator and 8Dio added a collection of custom convolution reverbs.\nSpecifications:\nDeep Phrase-Sampled Solo Violin.\n+4,000 Solo Violin Phrases.\n169 Programs in 39 Core Categories.\nTime-stretching and Pitch Control.\nProgrammed Individually for Kontakt 4 and Kontakt 5.\nDeep FX Controls &amp; Convolution Reverb.\nRequires Kontakt 4.2 or later.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10d05d07b066b6772a6b610b957f7ed017ac7e8a","amp;dn":"8DIO+Adiago+Violins+Kontakt+IMFG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10d05d07b066b6772a6b610b957f7ed017ac7e8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,208,93,7,176,102,182,119,42,107,97,11,149,127,126,208,23,172,126,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
