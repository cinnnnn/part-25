Bluegrass great Ricky Skaggs picks the mandolin on three tracks, renowned bass man Rene Comacho supplies the low end, and CooderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son Joachim rounds out the ultra-refined supergroup on the drums, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Haden Triplets and their untouched yet effortless harmonies, the kind that can only be derived via the preternatural harmonic instinct shared by siblings, that provide all of the chills (the good, non-flu kind). Steeped in tradition yet bereft of the sense of calculated authenticity that can sometimes seep into similarly sepia-toned projects, the Hadens have spent so much of their lives absorbing every instance of American music, from folk, country, and bluegrass to jazz, blues, and gospel, that the souls of the songs are in their very breaths, and in choosing to tackle covers for their first project together, they managed to unify three very distinct creative voices. Whether theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re emotionally dissecting an old Webb Pierce number (Ã¢â‚¬Å“SlowlyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), invoking the Carter Family and the Kossoy Sisters (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Single Girl, Married GirlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), or reminding listeners what damn fine songwriters Charlie and Ira Louvin were (Ã¢â‚¬Å“When I Stop DreamingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear that the mission is emotional verisimilitude. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not just repackaging the Dust Bowl and selling it back to its great-grandchildren at a higher price; theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re reminding listeners what it was like when the radio was the TV and music was the glue that brought the family together.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6c7e7fba15587521c8b82cc952f5313e95b6f01","amp;dn":"The+Haden+Triplets+-+The+Haden+Triplets+%282014%29+%5BThird+Man+Record","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6c7e7fba15587521c8b82cc952f5313e95b6f01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,199,231,251,161,85,135,82,28,139,130,204,149,47,83,19,233,91,111,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
