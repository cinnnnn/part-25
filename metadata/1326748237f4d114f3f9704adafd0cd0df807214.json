Setback\n2. Perfect Day\n3. Love Is A Murder (Feat. Cee-Lo)\n4. December\n5. Take A Ride\n6. Were Here To Save The Day (Feat. Asher Roth)\n7. Felicia\n8. Step Right Up\n9. What I See\n10. Remurder is a Lovemix\n11. On My Way Up\n\nNote:\n\nLooking up the tracklist I realize that the last two songs are not on the album. I have tried looking it up and found nothing so i guess enjoy. If you find a torrent/have the real 10 and 11 on it please leave comment and I will add it. Or upload it yourself. Probably would be better to keep it all in one place if you know what i mean. ;)\n\nAlso not that the songs may be unorganized in windows explorer (my computer does not allow me to change properties...fucking win32 app shit...but when you move into iTunes it should be organized. If not well hey.. I tried ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1326748237f4d114f3f9704adafd0cd0df807214","amp;dn":"The+Constellations+-+Southern+Gothic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1326748237f4d114f3f9704adafd0cd0df807214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,38,116,130,55,244,209,20,243,249,112,74,218,253,12,208,223,128,114,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
