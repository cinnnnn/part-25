This is a life-or-death mission for ONIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s black-ops team, Kilo-Five, which is tasked with preventing the ruthless Elites, once the military leaders of the Covenant, from regrouping and threatening humankind again. What began as a routine dirty-tricks operationÃ¢â‚¬â€¢keeping the Elites busy with their own insurrectionÃ¢â‚¬â€¢turns into a desperate bid to extract one member of Kilo-Five from the seething heart of an alien civil war. \nBut troubles never come singly for Kilo-Five. Colonial terrorism is once again surfacing on one of the worlds that survived the war against the Covenant, and the man behind it is much more than just a name to Spartan-010. Meanwhile, the treasure trove of Forerunner technology recovered from the shield world of Onyx is being put to work while a kidnapped Elite plots vengeance on the humans he fears will bring his people to the brink of destruction.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2123e1f6fd283753a2ac4ba6a4561f23b5ee2ca","amp;dn":"HALO%2C+The+Thursday+War+-+By+Karen+Traviss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2123e1f6fd283753a2ac4ba6a4561f23b5ee2ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,18,62,31,111,210,131,117,58,42,196,186,106,69,97,242,59,94,226,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
