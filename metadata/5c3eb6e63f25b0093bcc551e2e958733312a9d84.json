After introductory chapters on the fundamental material properties of titanium, readers will find comprehensive descriptions of the development, processing and properties of modern titanium alloys. There then follows a detailed discussion of the applications of titanium and its alloys in aerospace, medicine, energy and automotive technology.\nThe well-balanced mixture of authors from industry and academia makes this handbook especially useful as a hands-on reference in all fields of modern titanium research and technology.\nFrom the Back Cover\nTitanium alloys are well known as materials for the aerospace industry already since the 1940s. Nowadays, due to their superior properties- high specific strength, excellent corrosion resistance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they find increasing applications in chemical engineering, for body implants like hip replacements on in the off-shore industry, energy or automotive industry. Not to forget the increasing demand of the sports and consumer goods industry, e.g. for golf clubs, bicycles or jewelry, that make titanium a part of our everyday life already.\n\nThis handbook is an excellent reference for materials scientists and engineers that need to get more knowledge about the development, processing and application of titanium and titanium alloys. Following some introductory chapters about the fundamental materials properties of titanium the reader finds thorough descriptions of the development, processing and properties of modern titanium alloys. Furthermore, applications of titanium and its alloys in aerospace, medicine, energy and automotive technology are discussed in detail.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 532 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley-VCH (October 20, 2003)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3527305343\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3527305346","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c3eb6e63f25b0093bcc551e2e958733312a9d84","amp;dn":"Titanium+and+Titanium+Alloys-Principles+and+Applications%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c3eb6e63f25b0093bcc551e2e958733312a9d84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,62,182,230,63,37,176,9,59,204,85,30,46,149,135,51,49,42,157,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
