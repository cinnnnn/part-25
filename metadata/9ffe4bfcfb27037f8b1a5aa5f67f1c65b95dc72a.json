The only problem is that he's still in good health, and one day he turns 100. A big celebration is in the works, but Allan really isn't interested (and he'd like a bit more control over his vodka consumption). So he decides to escape. He climbs out the window in his slippers and embarks on a hilarious and entirely unexpected journey, involving, among other surprises, a suitcase stuffed with cash, some unpleasant criminals, a friendly hot-dog stand operator, and an elephant (not to mention a death by elephant).\n\nIt would be the adventure of a lifetime for anyone else, but Allan has a larger-than-life backstory: Not only has he witnessed some of the most important events of the twentieth century, but he has actually played a key role in them. Starting out in munitions as a boy, he somehow finds himself involved in many of the key explosions of the twentieth century and travels the world, sharing meals and more with everyone from Stalin, Churchill, and Truman, to Mao, Franco, and de Gaulle. Quirky and utterly unique, The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared has charmed readers across the world.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hesperuspress.com/Web/uploadImages/100YOM%20packshot%20(060112).jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hesperuspress.com/Web/uploadImages/100YOM%20packshot%20(060112).jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ffe4bfcfb27037f8b1a5aa5f67f1c65b95dc72a","amp;dn":"The+100-Year-Old+Man+Who+Climbed+Out+the+Window+and+Disappeared+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ffe4bfcfb27037f8b1a5aa5f67f1c65b95dc72a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,254,75,252,251,39,3,127,139,26,90,165,246,127,28,101,185,93,199,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
