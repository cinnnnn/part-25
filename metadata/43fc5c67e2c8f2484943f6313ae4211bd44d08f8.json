The band is managed by Steve Miller on guitar and lead vocals, and is known for a string of (mainly) mid-1970s hit singles that are staples of the classic rock radio format. Steve currently resides in West Des Moines, Iowa with his wife (Joan), three kids (David, Christopher, and Brianna) and their dog (Callie).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBrave New World is the third album by American rock band The Steve Miller Band, released in 1969. The tracks &quot;Celebration Song&quot; and &quot;My Dark Hour&quot; featured Paul McCartney on backing vocals, drums and bass guitar credited as Paul Ramon.\n\nThe primary guitar riff on &quot;My Dark Hour&quot; was also used on the title track to Steve Miller's 1976 album Fly Like An Eagle.\n\n&quot;Space Cowboy&quot; uses the same primary guitar riff as the Beatles' song &quot;Lady Madonna,&quot; owing perhaps to McCartney's involvement on &quot;My Dark Hour&quot; and allied permission. It was released as downloadable content for the video game Rock Band on January 20, 2009.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSteve Miller Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, harmonica, lead vocals\n\nGlyn Johns Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, percussion, backing vocals\n\nLonnie Turner Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, guitar, backing vocals\n\nBen Sidran Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards\n\nTim Davis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, lead vocals on &quot;Can You Hear Your Daddy's Heartbeat?&quot; &amp; &quot;LT's Midnight Dream&quot;.\n\nNicky Hopkins Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano on &quot;Kow Kow&quot;\n\nPaul McCartney (as &quot;Paul Ramon&quot;) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, bass guitar and backing vocals on &quot;My Dark Hour&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43fc5c67e2c8f2484943f6313ae4211bd44d08f8","amp;dn":"Steve+Miller+Band+-+Brave+New+World+%5B1969%5D%5B1989%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43fc5c67e2c8f2484943f6313ae4211bd44d08f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,252,92,103,226,200,242,72,73,67,246,49,58,228,33,27,212,77,8,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
