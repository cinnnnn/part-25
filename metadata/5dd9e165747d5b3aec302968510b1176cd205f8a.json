Neil Young expressed interest in the tapes, and suddenly, a new CSNY album was in the works. \nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Faith in me                                          [04:20]\n02.Looking forward                                      [03:08]\n03.Stand and be counted                                 [04:53]\n04.Heartland                                            [04:29]\n05.Seen enough                                          [05:14]\n06.Slowpoke                                             [04:32]\n07.Dream for him                                        [05:03]\n08.No tears left                                        [05:07]\n09.Out of control                                       [04:10]\n10.Someday soon                                         [03:44]\n11.Queen of them all                                    [04:23]\n12.Sanibel                                              [04:21]\n____\n\n53:24 min\n72,10 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dd9e165747d5b3aec302968510b1176cd205f8a","amp;dn":"Crosby_Stills_Nash_And_Young-Looking_Forward-%28Retail%29-1999-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dd9e165747d5b3aec302968510b1176cd205f8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,217,225,101,116,125,91,58,236,48,41,104,81,11,17,118,205,32,95,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
