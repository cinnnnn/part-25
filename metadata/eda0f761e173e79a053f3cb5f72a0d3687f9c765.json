After all, the swashbuckling cover to High Adventure fits this album, since it finds him relying equally on rockers and melodic pop/rock. The album kicks off with Loggins&amp;#039; hardest-rocking single, &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Fight It,&quot; a surging arena-rocker duet with Steve Perry. This signals that the rest of the record will be harder than his previous record and that&amp;#039;s true to a certain extent, since this doesn&amp;#039;t just rock on occasion, it also has his best ballads and mid-tempo charmers. In other words, it&amp;#039;s his best album, showcasing all sides of his personality effectively. &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Fight It&quot; is a great single, but the best moment here is &quot;Heart to Heart,&quot; the second of two pop classics Loggins cut as a solo artist. Here, he has a great mid-tempo groove, a good lyric and an indelible melody that is soft rock at its finest. The rest of the album may not match this height -- most of the genre didn&amp;#039;t -- but it&amp;#039;s all strong (though it&amp;#039;s awful strange that &quot;Heartlight,&quot; a tribute to the children&amp;#039;s foundation Heartlight, has the oddest melody he&amp;#039;s ever written -- an ominous march that just gets creepier when the children&amp;#039;s choir pops up at the end). Celebrate Me Home may be more consistent, but this is the most diverse record he ever cut, blessed by fine studio craft and a nice reliance on pseudo-new wave production techniques.\n\nReview from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:f9fpxql5ldte&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:f9fpxql5ldte&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eda0f761e173e79a053f3cb5f72a0d3687f9c765","amp;dn":"Kenny+Loggins+-+High+Adventure+-+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eda0f761e173e79a053f3cb5f72a0d3687f9c765","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,160,247,97,225,115,231,154,5,63,60,181,247,42,13,54,135,249,199,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
