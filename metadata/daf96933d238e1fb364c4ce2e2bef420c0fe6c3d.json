Take your pick.\n\nI don't really know anything about the artists on this compilation. It's an LP, bought in 1993 in Barbados. It's soca, plain and simple! &quot;Breakdown&quot; was a HUGE hit back then. &quot;One step forward and two step backward...&quot;\n\nThis is music that cheers me up, any day of the week! At least Serenader's and Hawk's songs.\n\nRipped by yours truly. I'd appreciate any comments, at least if they're longer than 4 words...\n\n\nTrack listing:\n\nSerenader - Breakdown            [7:10]\nAdonijah - Session Ram'          [5:47]\nSerenader - Shake It             [6:16]\nAdonijah - Soca In De Dance Hall [5:34]\nHawk - Soak Me Down              [5:48]\nP-Oui - Feeling Good             [5:13]\nHawk - Jump Up And Play          [4:46]\nP-Oui - Blow Yuh Whistle         [5:19]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daf96933d238e1fb364c4ce2e2bef420c0fe6c3d","amp;dn":"Soca+X4+%5Bvinyl+rip%2C+Barbados+1993%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daf96933d238e1fb364c4ce2e2bef420c0fe6c3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,249,105,51,210,56,225,251,54,76,76,226,226,190,244,32,192,254,108,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
