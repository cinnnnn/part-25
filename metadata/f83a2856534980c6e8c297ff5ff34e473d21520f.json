On this new recording, the veteran Guinean supergroup prove themselves as capable and sweet-sounding an Afropop band as any out there today. This new set, featuring several older players along with some new recruits, isn't as eerie or electrifying as their signature work from the 'Sixties and early '70s, but it's still pretty darn good. Recommended, particularly for fans of the cascading, melodic guitars of bands such as Orchestra Baobab, et al. \n\nBreezin says: &quot;If you are a fan of African music and rhythms, combined with some sophisticated guitarplaying and hornblowing, this is a must have.  Those who liked my upload of King Sunny Ade's JuJu Music will surely like this one as well!&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
