Target - 0.00 Apocalypse  320k    mp3     ak2014 What we got ...Taking a look at the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s album covers and song titles, you can see that they are quite a fan of the body horror genre of films, specifically Videodrome and Tetsuo: The Iron Man; Both of these films deal with the integration of mechanical components into organic tissue and the insane circumstances that the protagonists of both films encounter as a result. 7H Target are able to reflect this in their music by having a deranged vocal performance consisting of 3 different vocalists, an unrelenting drumming performance, and a guitar performance that is not only very catchy, but also very interesting in that they use the guitar playing to simulate industrial noises such as pistons firing and generators starting up (very evident in the first track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Videodrome with 7h Music,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ my personal favorite), and to top all of this off, they use film samples and ambiance and mechanical sound clips to further enhance the atmosphere along with an excellent production to tie it all together. This is all going on at once, so it makes for an incredibly intense experience, and one that I am constantly listening to over and over again to fully appreciate the genius of by discovering all of the the different components that make up the songs and make them work so well. It is a very short album too, which prevents it from getting too overbearing or stale. Alright I dont see much of this but than it is Brutal Death Metal....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:594c21b2df767d45c066e1c22b5fe5f42a994d02","amp;dn":"7+H.+Target+-+0.00+Apocalypse++320k++++mp3+++++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"594c21b2df767d45c066e1c22b5fe5f42a994d02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,76,33,178,223,118,125,69,192,102,225,194,43,95,229,244,42,153,77,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
