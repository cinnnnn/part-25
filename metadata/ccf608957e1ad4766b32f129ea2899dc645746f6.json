Instead, this amalgam of Sheffield and Manchester folk have taken an eclectic trip through showbiz history and combined the swirling Moog sound of everyone from Hawkwind to Psychedelic Shack-period Temptations, added a fair smattering of psychedelically-honed guitar, the orchestral wavering of a thousand film scores and an uptempo beat. Central to this strangely contemporary stew is a state-of-the-larynx vocal from Tony Ogden, which is underplayed and at times a bit too undynamic. But there are highlights as World Of Twist's art school groove places them in a musical relationship with Electronic, much as Deaf School were with Roxy Music. Quality Street and its tongue-in-cheek humour survives through its musical inventiveness. Whether that's enough to carry them to a wider audience is debatable, though it's not by any means impossible.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf608957e1ad4766b32f129ea2899dc645746f6","amp;dn":"World+Of+Twist+-+Quality+Street+%5B1991%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf608957e1ad4766b32f129ea2899dc645746f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,246,8,149,126,26,212,118,107,50,241,41,234,40,153,220,100,87,70,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
