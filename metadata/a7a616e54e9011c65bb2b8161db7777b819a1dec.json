Blake Shelton recorded the song for his EP All About Tonight, from which it was released as the second single in August 2010. His version debuted at number 51 on Billboard Hot Country Songs charts for the week of September 25, 2010.\n\nThe music video premiered on October 1, 2010 during CMT's Big New Music Weekend.\n\nThe song is a ballad in which the narrator wants to know the characteristics his lover's hiding from him (e.g. &quot;do you paint your toes 'cause you bite your nails?&quot;).\n\nMatt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song a four-out-of-five star rating, calling it a &quot;list song,&quot; but the lyrics &quot;an emotion in which anyone who has been in love will certainly relate to.&quot;.&quot; Jim Malec of American Twang gave the song a thumbs-up review, calling it an &quot;intimate rumination on the mystery of a beautiful, graceful woman.&quot;\n\nKarlie Justus of The 9513 gave the song a thumbs-up. She thought that Shelton's performance was &quot;flatter&quot; than Nichols', but said that the lyrics were &quot;grounded and honest.&quot; Gary Graff of Billboard also described the song positively, saying that it &quot;mixes humor and pathos with a sweet melody and a wry attitude.&quot;\n\nAll About Tonight is the second extended play, and seventh studio release by American country music artist Blake Shelton. It was released on August 10, 2010, via Warner Music Group Nashville, under its Reprise label. The first single, &quot;All About Tonight,&quot; was released to radio in April 2010 and has become his seventh Number One hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. The album's second single, &quot;Who Are You When I'm Not Looking&quot; (previously recorded by Joe Nichols on his album Real Things), was released to radio in August 2010.\n\nAll About Tonight is Shelton's second &quot;Six Pak&quot;, a concept that he and his record label decided to experiment with in 2010 starting with Hillbilly Bone. Shelton said, &quot;We're looking for ways to remind people that we still make albums, and there's still cool music that you may or may not hear on the radio. So we decided to do a six-song album, and it's really cheap! It's like five dollars and change&quot;.\n\nIn an interview with &quot;The Boot&quot;, Rhett Akins talked about the title track, a song he co-wrote along with Ben Hayslip and Dallas Davidson, saying &quot;We decided that we wanted to write a song about how we just don't care about tomorrow because tomorrow can wait until tomorrow ... it's all about tonight! It's a good, fun party song about where the night is going to go. After we wrote it, we thought it sounds just like a Blake Shelton song&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7a616e54e9011c65bb2b8161db7777b819a1dec","amp;dn":"Blake+Shelton-Who+Are+You+When+I%5C%27m+Not+Looking%28mp4-2nafish%291080","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7a616e54e9011c65bb2b8161db7777b819a1dec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,166,22,229,78,144,17,198,91,178,184,22,29,183,119,123,129,154,29,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
