Following this we'll examine an image of some flames and explore how we can weave various parts of these flames into our photo using free transform and layer masks in photoshop.\n\nFrom there we'll also examine and adjust a texture that we plan to clone onto our photo to create the illusion of molten cracked skin. Finally, we'll finish by painting in some final details with our brush tool and make our image pop by adjusting it with an adjustment layer.\n\nBy utilizing the methods and techniques in this course, you'll be able to push your own photo manipulation projects involving fire to a whole new creative level while having a lot of fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cd1b41ce6ae56cf9c5fcdda4a1ea849b0129de9","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+Playing+With+Fire+Through+Photo+Manipulation_2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cd1b41ce6ae56cf9c5fcdda4a1ea849b0129de9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,209,180,28,230,174,86,207,156,95,205,218,74,30,168,73,176,18,157,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
