But everything goes awry when he meets his potential brother-in-law Todd (Bobby Moynihan): a full-time camp counselor with a heart of gold and a wild sense of fun, pining to be Roger's best friend, and ultimately catapulting him into a series of unfortunate events. As Roger tries to take a stand amidst outrageous fishing excursions, propulsive water jetpacks and American history-themed musicals, he realizes that being a part of a new family may be more difficult than he'd thought","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c773d1702d368e6f5b3ffe498d11f289ba2335f","amp;dn":"Brother+Nature+2016+HDRip+XviD+AC3-EVO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c773d1702d368e6f5b3ffe498d11f289ba2335f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,119,61,23,2,211,104,230,245,179,255,228,152,209,31,40,155,162,51,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
