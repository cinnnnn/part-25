A massive gash in the fabric of our reality roils against the horizon as it blends into a permanently darkened sky. The world as we know it has come to an end. Demons, the visions of our nightmares, walk the Earth. Mankind, driven in retreat to the sanctuary of the Underground, struggles to survive the Hellish apocalypse. \n\nAmong the survivors are those who foresaw the coming of the darkness, those who see it as an opportunity to improve the standing of man, and those who seek revenge for what was lost. All are now banding together in the shadows, arming themselves with futuristic weapons and arcane spells designed for one purpose -- to battle the demonic hordes and take back their world.\n\nFollow me on twitter: @livhre\nRequest books on twitter: @livhre\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6150ab5d96201dbe2fd0c9834e2203308ceb527","amp;dn":"Hellgate%3A+London%3A+Exodus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6150ab5d96201dbe2fd0c9834e2203308ceb527","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,21,10,181,217,98,1,219,226,253,12,152,52,226,32,51,8,206,181,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
