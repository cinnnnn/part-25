PhotoZoom Pro 5 is equipped with S-Spline Max, a unique, patented image resize technology which excels at preserving clean edges, sharpness, and fine details.\n\nEven noisy, compressed originals can be enlarged successfully. Normally, noise and JPEG compression artifacts become disturbingly visible during enlargement. PhotoZoom Pro 5 however offers the tools to eliminate these distortions. You'll be amazed by the amount of detail PhotoZoom Pro 5 is able to dig up from below the mess.\n\nPhotoZoom Pro 5 is extremely easy to use, and comes with various pre-defined settings. These settings can be manually fine-tuned as well. You can even put together your own resize profiles: compilations of your favorite resize method and size settings, which can be selected with a single click. When you often use the same settings, resize profiles will streamline your workflow.\n\nLarge quantities of images can be resized in one go, through batch processing. Multi-processor support, 64-bit support, and the new GPU acceleration included with PhotoZoom Pro 5 ensure reduced processing time.\n\nPhotoZoom Pro 5 works both as a stand-alone application and as a plug-in for various host programs, such as AdobeÃ‚Â® PhotoshopÃ‚Â®, AdobeÃ‚Â® PhotoshopÃ‚Â® Elements, CorelÃ‚Â® PHOTO-PAINT, and CorelÃ‚Â® PaintShop Pro.\n\nOptimized for both printing and on-screen purposes, PhotoZoom Pro 5 is an absolute must-have for anyone who wants to resize images at the highest possible quality.\nSupported Languages\n\nInstallation instructions:\n1. Execute the .exe file.\n2. Follow the instructions.\n3. Enjoy the program.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ed9147fe3d6eb317932009eb728e3b5b8d8708f","amp;dn":"PhotoZoom+Prof.+v5.1.2+Multilinguage+%28registered%29%282-click+run%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ed9147fe3d6eb317932009eb728e3b5b8d8708f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,217,20,127,227,214,235,49,121,50,0,158,183,40,227,181,184,216,112,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
