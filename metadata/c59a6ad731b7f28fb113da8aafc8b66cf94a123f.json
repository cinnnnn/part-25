But when an electrical storm creates havoc for the people of Gotham City, an inexperienced Kate can't deny her duty to protect the innocent!\n\nBut it will also now be a 40-page issue and cost $3.99.\n\n------\n\nIt's well documented, but bears repeating, the fan-favorite, critically-acclaimed creative team quit this book because after approving the plots, editorial refused to allow the Batwoman character to marry Maggie Sawyer.\n\nNothing like making it up to the fans with a mish-mash art team, a tie-in to an ill-conceived Snyder storyline, and a price increase!\n\nDC wants this title to fail?  --STF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c59a6ad731b7f28fb113da8aafc8b66cf94a123f","amp;dn":"BATWOMAN+025+%282014%29+%28DC+The+New+52%29+%28Digital%29+%28Nahga-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c59a6ad731b7f28fb113da8aafc8b66cf94a123f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,154,106,215,49,183,242,143,177,19,218,138,175,200,182,108,249,74,18,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
