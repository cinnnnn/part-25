But the fact is they develop structural damage over time. While not always as dramatic as the collapse of a roof section at the Paris Charles de Gaulle airport in 2004, gradual changes also occur that may compromise a building's appearance and structure. These changes include efflorescence, thermal stress, material incompatibilities, corrosion, and impact. Failed Stone systematically analyzes cases of damage in contemporary international architecture and offers strategies for minimizing the risk of damage. Examples include such high-visibility structures as Finlandia Hall in Helsinki by Alvar Aalto, Renzo Piano's Parco della Musica in Rome, and the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington. In nine chapters, typical kinds of damage are explained and illustrated with real-world examples.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92d75af7ddecf000ce9e222acf4538938008cf43","amp;dn":"Failed+Stone%3A+Problems+and+Solutions+with+Concrete+and+Masonry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92d75af7ddecf000ce9e222acf4538938008cf43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,215,90,247,221,236,240,0,206,158,34,42,207,69,56,147,128,8,207,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
