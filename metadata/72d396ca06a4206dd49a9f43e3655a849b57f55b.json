Although taped earlier in December, 1999, the concert was originally broadcast via Pay-per-view on New Year's Eve, 1999. The concert features several notable cover versions, and some Prince's biggest hits. Special guests included former band associates, Rosie Gaines and Morris Day, funk legends Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone such as bass player Larry Graham, as well as funk-rock performer, Lenny Kravitz. The concert is notable for &quot;retiring&quot; Prince's classic hit, &quot;1999&quot; (although it would be reintroduced to his performances in subsequent years).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
