Original film is of failry poor quality (scratches, bleak colors etc) so do not expect \\&quot;the blue planet\\&quot; quality.\n\nThis is for the historically interested diver as it gives a view of the untouched read sea and the early diving equipment. \n\nI dont know the bitrate of sound and video, but it is enough for the poor sound and picture that the original film has. \n\nIt\\&amp;#039;s all in swedish.
