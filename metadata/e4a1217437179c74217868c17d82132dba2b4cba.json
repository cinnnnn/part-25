We did have songs like &quot;Someone \nSaved My Life Tonight,&quot; which is one of the best songs that Bernie and I \nhave ever written together. But whether a song like that could be a single\nthese days, since it's practically six minutes long, is questionable. \nCaptain Fantastic was written from start to finish in running order, \nas a kind of story about coming to terms with failure--or trying \ndesperately not to be one. lived that story....That whole \nalbum, Captain Fantastic, sounds so damn good when I hear it now. \nGus Dudgeon was a great producer, and we as a band were at our\npeak. Momentum is everything in music, and we were really getting\nour own--our adrenaline was flowing. At the time, I thought it\nwas a completely commercial-free album. It didn't have any \ndeliberate pop songs on it like &quot;Crocodile Rock.&quot; It wasn't \nabout that anyway--it was about our experience, so it was like\na mini-operetta in a way.&quot;\n\nCd ripped to flac using EAC.
