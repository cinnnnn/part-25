Currently progresed at season 2.\n\nThe story revolves around Team KDY, a amateur team formed by a group of friends in university. Include friendship, romance, past trauma but mostly fan-service...(and shit lots of yaoi...as requested by female fans) &quot;\n\n=====================================================\n\nfansubbing-translation notes (by brabroke):\n\nSubbing this show is VERY HARD because the amount of chinese pop-culture refrences (and some of them I dont even get it). And insane amount of Chinese PUNS. Even the shows name and the studio name is a pun. Penta is the Chinese prounceation for flaming at them, and the title lu, was a corrupted version of the letter l, which means fap. It was a trend caused by a joke in an early lol rant video by a oc called xiaodong, in which he prouced LoL in a corrupted accent, resulted the rise of the &quot;fapper&quot;. The correct translation for the title is actually &quot;Era of LoL&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49ce542b32bbc23349b8b600dc4b56987cbb6047","amp;dn":"Lu%27s+Time+-+Season+1+%28League+of+Legends+Anime%29%28Eng+Sub%29%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49ce542b32bbc23349b8b600dc4b56987cbb6047","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,206,84,43,50,187,194,51,73,184,182,0,220,75,86,152,124,187,96,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
