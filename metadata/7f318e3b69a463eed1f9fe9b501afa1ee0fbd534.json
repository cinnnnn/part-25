Thanks.\n\nExposureÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 2: The worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best film simulator just got better. \n\nExposure 2 is the new, even more feature-packed version of our award-winning Photoshop plug-in that gives digital photographs the look and feel of film.\n\nWhether youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a fashion or wedding photographer, a designer or art director, with Exposure 2 youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have one-click access to the broadest range of film stocks and special effects settings available in any software package. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why Exposure 2 is the closest thing to film since film.\n\nPick a film, any film. When it comes to the variety of films you can simulate, Exposure 2 has no peer. You can match the look of popular film stocks like PortraÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, VelviaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, KodachromeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, PolaroidÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, and TRI-XÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve even saved some films from extinction in Exposure 2, like AgfaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® ScalaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, GAFÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 500, and KodakÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® EES.\n\nIt all comes down to grain. Exposure 2 gives you the most realistic grain on the market, now with even more control over sharpness, color variation, and intensity throughout the tonal range. And since Exposure 2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s grain size automatically adjusts to your image size, you get consistent results across all of your cameras.\n\nMore effective effects. With over 300 presets, Exposure 2 has even more special effects settings than before, including push and cross processing, a vastly improved infrared simulator, and sophisticated color to black and white conversion.\n\nSo easy to use. Exposure 2 simplifies your workflow by collecting color, dynamic range, softness, and grain control into one easy-to-use plug-in. Correct a colorcast, soften a digital portrait, or tweak contrast with our powerful slider and curve controls. Or even define your signature look and save it as a one-click effect.\n\nCheck out the examples:-\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alienskin.com/exposure/exposure_examples.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alienskin.com/exposure/exposure_examples.aspx&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f318e3b69a463eed1f9fe9b501afa1ee0fbd534","amp;dn":"Exposure+2.0.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f318e3b69a463eed1f9fe9b501afa1ee0fbd534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,49,142,59,105,164,99,238,209,249,254,155,80,26,250,30,224,251,213,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
