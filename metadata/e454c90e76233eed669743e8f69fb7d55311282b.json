Twenty-four hours later, all contact is lost. Captain Alex Hunter and his highly trained commandos, along with a team of scientists, are fast tracked to the hot zone to find out what went wrong. Meanwhile, the alluring petrobiologist Aimee Weir is sent to follow up on the detection of a vast underground reservoir. If the unidentified substance proves to be oil, every country in the world will want to know about itÃ¢â‚¬â€even wage war over it. Or worse.\n\nOnce suspended into the caves, Alex, Aimee, and the others canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t locate a single survivorÃ¢â‚¬â€or even a trace of their remains. Nor is there a energy source, only specters of the dead haunting the tunnels. But soon they will discover that something very much alive is brewing beneath the surface. It is a force that dates back to the very dawn of timeÃ¢â‚¬â€an ancient terror that hunts and kills to survive...\n\n\nDark Rising (Alex Hunter #2)\n\n\n\nWhen a massive amount of gamma radiation is detected somewhere beneath the desert of Iran, the world is on edge. Is it a nuclear weaponÃ¢â‚¬â€or worse? Alex Hunter and his highly trained incursion team is on a mission to find out. When they arrive at the ruins of Persepolis, they find an underground facility but no lab, no weapons, no scientistsÃ¢â‚¬â€not even radiation. A black hole has taken everythingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nMeanwhile, Iran is preparing for the return of the prophet. Israel is threatening nuclear war. And the details about AlexÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s special U.S. military ventureÃ¢â‚¬â€code name: ArcadianÃ¢â‚¬â€have been stolen. Then another gamma spike is detectedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and someone, or something, is draining the fluids from the bodies of Iranian soldiers in the desert.\n\nNow itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Alex to follow the traces of radiation all the way to the ancient caves of Arak, where heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll come face to face with a creature from his darkest nightmares. Is it game-over for Alex and his team? Or are greater forces at work as the world reaches its natural endÃ¢â‚¬â€and mankind casts its final judgment?\n\n\n\nThis Green Hell (Alex Hunter #3)\n\nDeep in the steaming jungles of Paraguay, Aimee Weir is in trouble.\nThe petrobiologist has found what she was looking for Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a unique microorganism in a natural gas deposit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but it proves to be more destructive than anyone could have imagined. A contagion is striking down all in its wake. The camp is quarantined, but workers start to vanish in the night.\nIs it fear of contamination Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or has something far more lethal come to the surface?\nAlex Hunter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ code name Arcadian Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and his Hotzone All-Forces Warfare Commandos must be dropped in to the disaster area to do whatever it takes to stem the outbreak. It has been a year since Aimee has seen Alex; she thought she had left him for good.
