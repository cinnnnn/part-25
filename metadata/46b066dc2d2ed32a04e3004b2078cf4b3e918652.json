When not playing R&amp;B in New Orleans clubs, Eaglin busked with an acoustic guitar, which is how folklorist Harry Oster recorded him. At first lionized by white fans, happy that Big Bill Broonzy wasn't the last of the line, he was later shunned as just an eclectist copyist. Neither misapprehension made much difference to Eaglin, who'd seen little money from the LPs that were released. He went on to cut some R&amp;B sessions, but had virtually retired by 1971, when he was sought out for the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival. Since then he's kept busy playing and recording his technically brillant, infallibly swinging electric guitar music.\nRecorded during the time in which Eaglin was doubling as a blues/folk singer and a commercial R&amp;B artist (for Imperial). He addresses the acoustic folk and blues side of his repertoire, performing everything solo. Time will probably judge these not to be as interesting as his full-band New Orleans R&amp;B recordings. But this is warm, good-natured acoustic blues, with interpretations of traditional tunes.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46b066dc2d2ed32a04e3004b2078cf4b3e918652","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Blind+Snooks+Eaglin+-+That%5C%27s+All+Right","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46b066dc2d2ed32a04e3004b2078cf4b3e918652","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,176,102,220,45,46,211,42,4,227,0,75,32,120,207,75,62,145,134,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
