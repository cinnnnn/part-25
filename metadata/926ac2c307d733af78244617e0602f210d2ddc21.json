After a couple\nof years working in Europe, he returned to the release scene in the U.S. with An\nAmerican Compilation in June of 2006. That disc was a selection of tracks from\nthis album, his remix disc, and live cuts of tunes from the ECM period. In fact,\nER is being issued simultaneously with Streamer, the live CD. MolvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦r is now on\nthe Thirsty Ear imprint and these recordings are being issued via the label's\nBlue Series, which is curated by Matthew Shipp. Some have questioned whether the\ntrumpeter and composer's work is actually &quot;jazz.&quot; Interestingly, the Europeans\ndon't give it a second thought. Who cares anyway? What the tracks on ER point to\nis what a compelling musician and writer MolvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦r is. In association with\nguitarist Eivind Aarset, bassist Ingebrigt Flaten, drummer Rune Arnesen,\nvocalist Sidsel Endresen, and a host of other sidemen who do everything from\nprogramming to organic percussion to playing pianos and other keyboards, MolvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦r\nhas created a dreamy, seductive, and utterly compelling brand of new\nelectronically kissed jazz. Rhythms are everywhere to be found, from drums and\npercussion instruments to loops and samples. MolvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦r's trumpet is warm, rounded,\nplayed sparely. He's not looking for fire; he's content with the smoldering\nsmoke. Check tracks like the utterly beguiling &quot;Only These Things Count,&quot;\nfronted by the trumpeter and Endresen's gorgeous yet plaintive vocal. On\n&quot;Darker,&quot; the trumpeter's melody is the only thing that keeps the track in a\ngroove as cross-cutting -- yet sparsely programmed -- loops cross hairs in the\nmiddle. Aarset's guitar playing is heavy on atmosphere and void of any\ninstrumental masturbation disguised as guitar heroics. Elsewhere, such as on the\nshimmering &quot;Water,&quot; Endresen's all but wordless vocals in three ranges appear\nand slip into the ether, and MolvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦r's trumpet is more reminiscent of Jon\nHassell. Rhythmic invention is created despite the programming. Dynamics shift\nand flow with rhythmic tensions, and the whole thing feels like an enchanting\ndream. The set concludes with the spaced-out and melodically inventive &quot;Dancer,&quot;\nwhere drones of trumpet, keyboards, and guitar are matched by organic\npercussion, a drum kit, and vinyl channeling. The drums and percussion\ninstruments chant their rhythms as MolvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦r floats around them with a skeletal yet\npronounced melody. He's the singer in the tune as Aarset hovers, gracing the\nproceedings with another sonic dimension. In sum, it's a gorgeous set and one of\nMolvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦r's best. ER is a welcome return, and hopefully listeners won't have to\nwait years to get caught up on his activities from now on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:926ac2c307d733af78244617e0602f210d2ddc21","amp;dn":"Nils+Petter+Molvaer+-+ER+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"926ac2c307d733af78244617e0602f210d2ddc21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,106,194,195,7,215,51,175,120,36,70,23,224,96,47,33,13,45,220,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
