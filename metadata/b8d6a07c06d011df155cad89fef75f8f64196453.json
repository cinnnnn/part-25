Fish live, breed, and die within the virtual aquarium that you set up. This game is old. I believe the first edition came out in 1993 this one is circa 97-98 and is for Windows 95. This is the edition before Smith-Micro took over the Aquazone series from 9003Inc and turned Aquazone into a crappy screensaver app. I love this game, and is a must try for aquarium enthusiasts. Sadly, I don't see this game offered around the net anymore so I am starting this torrent to keep it alive.\n\nThis program is confirmed working on a PC with XP and Macs with Classic OS installed. It is confirmed NOT working on Windows 7 64bit, other than that I am not sure\n\nThe torrent is just the Aquazone CD ISO file\nThe disk contains:\n\nNeon Tetras\nLeopard Catfish\nAngelfish\nBlack Mollies\n\nI have alot more fish as seperate add-ins which I may add in another torrent later if anyone wants them.\n\nEnjoy :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8d6a07c06d011df155cad89fef75f8f64196453","amp;dn":"Aquazone+Deluxe+with+Angelfish+and+Black+Mollies+PC%2FMAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8d6a07c06d011df155cad89fef75f8f64196453","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,214,160,124,6,208,17,223,21,92,173,137,254,247,95,143,100,25,100,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
