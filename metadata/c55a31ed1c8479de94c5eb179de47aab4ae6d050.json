The film is based on the 1952 novel by the prolific crime author, Margery Allingham, and while itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s number 14 of the Allingham Albert Campion novels, no mention of Campion appears in the film.\n\nThe film is set in post WWII London. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s November, late afternoon, and in terms of fog itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a peasouper--fog so dense and thick that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult to see more than a few steps ahead. The film opens with a string of street musicians, 6 in all, walking in single-file through the crowded, noisy London marketplaces. One of them sits in an ad-hoc cart of sorts while another jiggles a collecting box on which the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“ex-servicemenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is written. While the musicians could be seen as just another element of local colour, their presence is seminal to the film. \n\nA gang of war veterans masquerading as street musicians are searching the London underworld for Jack Havoc, their former sergeant, who, during a wartime commando raid on a French Chateau, deprived them of some hidden loot.\n\nAtmospheric adaptation of a thriller by Margery Allingham about a gang of ex-servicemen at large in a marvellously foggy London. This skilfully-set British film boasts some wonderfully skewed camerawork from cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth \n\nBritish cinema fans keep your eyes open for Stratford Johns in an early role as a police constable. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no mistaking that voice.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 952mb\nDuration.... 01:29:14\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 688\nFrame Height.... 568\nData Rate.... 1365kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 123kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c55a31ed1c8479de94c5eb179de47aab4ae6d050","amp;dn":"Tiger+in+the+Smoke+1956+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c55a31ed1c8479de94c5eb179de47aab4ae6d050","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,90,49,237,28,132,121,222,148,197,235,23,157,228,122,171,74,230,208,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
