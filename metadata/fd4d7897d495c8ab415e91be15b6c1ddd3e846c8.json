Set free to headline a benefit concert organized by an unscrupulous promoter (John Goodman) and television executive (Jessica Lange), Jack embarks on a fateful journey through a battle-scarred land. Taken literally, Masked and Anonymous proves bewildering, even exasperating, but as a feverish act of unrestrained political satire the film has a lot to offer, including some of the best recent performances by Goodman, Lange, Jeff Bridges (as a cynical journalist), Val Kilmer (a babbling prophet), Luke Wilson (a musician), and Giovanni Ribisi (a haunted soldier). Dylan himself proves a stiff cipher, but fun to watch. --Tom Keogh","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd4d7897d495c8ab415e91be15b6c1ddd3e846c8","amp;dn":"Masked+And+Anonymous.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd4d7897d495c8ab415e91be15b6c1ddd3e846c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,77,120,151,212,149,200,171,65,94,145,190,21,182,193,221,211,232,70,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
