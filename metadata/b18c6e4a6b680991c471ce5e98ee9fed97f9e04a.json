After the success of &quot;The Flame&quot; from the previous album Lap of Luxury, the band recorded Busted with a similar format, especially on the single &quot;Can't Stop Fallin' Into Love.&quot; The single peaked at #12 on the US charts. The album failed to be as successful as the label had hoped, and about a year after the release of Busted Epic Records dropped Cheap Trick from their label. There were three videos shot for this LP; &quot;Can't Stop Fallin' Into Love,&quot; &quot;If You Need Me,&quot; and &quot;Wherever Would I Be.&quot;\n\n1.&quot;Back 'n Blue&quot; (Taylor Rhodes, Robert A.
