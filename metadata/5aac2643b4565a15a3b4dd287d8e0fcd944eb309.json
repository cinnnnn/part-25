Thank you.\n\n\n\n\nThe Ghost Goes West\n\nPeggy Martin (Parker), the daughter of a rich American businessman (Eugene Pallette), persuades him to purchase a Scottish castle from Donald Glourie (Robert Donat), dismantle it and move it to Florida. Along with the castle goes its ghost.\n\nMurdoch Glourie (Donat again) haunts the castle after dying a cowardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death in the 18th century. To find rest, he must get a descendant of the enemy Clan MacClaggan to admit that one Glourie is worth fifty MacClaggans.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aac2643b4565a15a3b4dd287d8e0fcd944eb309","amp;dn":"The+ghost+goes+West+++B%2FW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aac2643b4565a15a3b4dd287d8e0fcd944eb309","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,172,38,67,180,86,90,21,163,180,221,40,125,142,15,205,148,78,179,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
