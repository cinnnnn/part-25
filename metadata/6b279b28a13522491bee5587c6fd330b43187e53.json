This &quot;inconvenient truth&quot; is 95-pages and provides clear and convincing evidence that all health care workers must become certified in palliative care. Hundreds of millions of people--at any given time--are being denied the basic human right of treatment with palliative care. During the past 3+ decades, billions of dollars have been expended to study this needless and persistent global problem. This special report clearly reveals the problem and also provides a practical and SIMPLE solution. \n\nWarning! Don't be victimized by this senseless situation! Read this report and save yourself or a loved one from being slowly tortured to death at the hands of ignorant and greedy health care workers. Millions of people (&quot;patients&quot;) are needless dying prolonged and insufferable deaths each year because of this situation. Take action!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b279b28a13522491bee5587c6fd330b43187e53","amp;dn":"Special+Report%3A+Clear+and+convincing+evidence+that+all+healthcar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b279b28a13522491bee5587c6fd330b43187e53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,39,155,40,161,53,34,73,27,238,85,135,198,253,51,11,67,24,126,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
