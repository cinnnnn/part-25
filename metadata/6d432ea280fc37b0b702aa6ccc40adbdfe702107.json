It was a very good movie, although a little underdeveloped. The characters aren&amp;#039;t explained very well, and you had to kind of guess in some parts. The reason she walked at Worlds&amp;#039; isn&amp;#039;t revealed until the middle/end of the movie, so that was a bit annoying. Some of the jokes the jerky girl makes were too stupid to even make sense, and kind of left me puzzled. Some lines were hard to understand, but then again, there were annoying little 10 year olds talking right in front of me. It&amp;#039;s sad to say, but most of the good parts were in the preview. Hope there&amp;#039;s a sequel to explain a little more about it. All the gymnasts and extras/stunt doubles have SICK bodies. I have sooo much more respect for people that do gymnastics after seeing this movie. I recommend it, but maybe wait to see it in the cheap theaters or until it&amp;#039;s out on video. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d432ea280fc37b0b702aa6ccc40adbdfe702107","amp;dn":"Stick+It+DVDR+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d432ea280fc37b0b702aa6ccc40adbdfe702107","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,67,46,162,128,252,55,176,183,2,170,108,204,64,173,189,254,112,33,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
