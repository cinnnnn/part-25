It is the full set with the second Real Drums 2 Disk as a supplement.\nThe only (but HUGE) difference is that these two files are in a standard .iso disk image format. This should make it much easier to use just about any disk burning sofware- PC, Linux or Mac - to effortlessly burn the two disks for installation. \nI managed to install the originals only after converting to this .iso format (which was difficult and took a lot of time). So, considering the number of complaints I read on the Bouganville posting, I decided to up these converted .iso files.\n\nNo serial required!\n\nClean. Check it out for yourselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4ac865ef3357cfee10da7971c5fa622e6c79243","amp;dn":"Band-in-a-Box+2007+%28.iso+format%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4ac865ef3357cfee10da7971c5fa622e6c79243","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,172,134,94,243,53,124,254,225,13,167,151,28,95,166,34,230,199,146,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
