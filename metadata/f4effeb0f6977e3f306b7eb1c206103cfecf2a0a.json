Along the way, the collection covers every major artist, from Bob Wills and Spade Cooley to pioneers like Milton Brown and Bill Boyd, who have been under-represented almost to the point of extinction in the CD era. It also includes Patsy Montana&amp;#039;s groundbreaking hit single, &quot;I Want to Be a Cowboy&amp;#039;s Sweetheart,&quot; and other fascinating tracks such as the Tex-Mex stomper &quot;El Rancho Grande&quot; by the Tune Wranglers, &quot;Bring It on Down to My House&quot; by Derwood Brown &amp; His Musical Brownies, and dozens of others. The accompanying 43-page booklet features bios on all the artists as well as song notes and rare photographs. Unfortunately, this doesn&amp;#039;t include anything after 1947, but such is the nature of Proper boxes. Besides, this doesn&amp;#039;t claim to be an exhaustive chronology -- the subtitle, &quot;The Golden Years of Western Swing,&quot; states the intent and, as such, this is magnificent stuff. Considering what&amp;#039;s been included, it&amp;#039;s hard to squabble over what&amp;#039;s been left out (&quot;Take Me Back to Tulsa,&quot; &quot;Milk Cow Blues,&quot; and &quot;Steel Guitar Rag&quot; are notable examples), but pretend you don&amp;#039;t know that and this set is perfect, containing every artist, every development, and every song that made Western swing a national phenomenon.\n\nDisc: 1\n1.
