It is an all consuming book. It is certainly not a book for the squeamish, yet even the squeamish, I believe, will be hypnotized by this book. Though hallucinatory, the writing is extremely clear, crisp, succinct, as the narrator literally eviscerates himself for the reader. Yet, at the end I found myself with an unanswerable question: are the hallucinations a distortion of reality, or really closer to the reality of the world?&quot;\n\nNick Cave said this:\n\n&quot;This is repulsive writing. Brilliant, disciplined and repulsive writingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦&quot;\n\nDennis Cooper said this:\n\n&quot; M. Gira is an astonishing writer whose belief in the power of language is almost supernatural. The Consumer is one of the purest, scariest, and most beautiful books IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve read in years.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c26708b1a1ab996872e98da7da94b51725ac8c4","amp;dn":"The+Consumer+by+M.+Gira","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c26708b1a1ab996872e98da7da94b51725ac8c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,38,112,139,26,26,185,150,135,46,152,218,125,169,75,81,114,90,200,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
