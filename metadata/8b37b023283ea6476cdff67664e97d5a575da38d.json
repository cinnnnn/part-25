Yet they're delivered with a crystal clear, sweet wisp of a voice and with melodies so refreshing you'd think they were more of the same earth loving folk songs we're inundated with. The Sun and the Wind seems like the wrong title for a collection of sad themes like this but really, it's perfect because these songs sound more resigned than depressing. Maybe not resigned but accepting. Burns sounds genuinely understanding of the way the world works, how time takes people that you love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b37b023283ea6476cdff67664e97d5a575da38d","amp;dn":"Forest+City+Lovers+-+The+Sun+And+The+Wind+%5B2006%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b37b023283ea6476cdff67664e97d5a575da38d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,55,176,35,40,62,166,71,108,223,246,118,100,233,125,90,87,93,163,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
