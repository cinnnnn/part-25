It was produced by Tulalip tribal member and musician Brodie Stevens, aka &quot;Redskin,&quot; who also provided music for the fiolm, from footage shot by Ben Hampton. ICTMN contributor and Thing About Skins ringleader Gyasi Ross provides narration, and elder Ramona Bennett gives a moving speech.\n\n&quot;This is a continuation of the 500-year-long indigenous resistance,&quot; Ross says. &quot;It's much bigger than one piece of legislation. It's much bigger than Prime Minister Harper. ... It's about this continual resistance we've got to a consumeristic, non-indigenous, non-sustainable way of life.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c580fb9c2830794908ed746de4ebe8acd6deaa8","amp;dn":"Idle+No+More+%282013%29+%27If+all+you+have+is+your+body%2C+put+it+there%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c580fb9c2830794908ed746de4ebe8acd6deaa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,88,15,185,194,131,7,148,144,142,215,70,222,78,190,138,205,109,234,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
