This politicaly engaged album is filled with mind blowing guitar solos, fast technical drum patterns and catchy vocal melodies &amp; harmonies that will leave you mesmerized. No Intensity from Reset. This new musical masterpiece will astonish everyone without exception.\n\nFor those who don&amp;#039;t know about Reset, a crucial turning point occured in the music industry back in 1995 when the band was formed. Undisputedly one of Canada?s most influencial punk rock trio caught the attention playing with bands such as Greenday, Blink 182, AFI, NOFX, MxPx, Pennywise, Lagwagon, Strungout and many, many more... The band got much retroactive attention lately due to three ex-Reset members being into the well-known Pop-Punk quintet &quot;Simple Plan&quot;. Most Simple Plan fans agree that Reset,mainly because of Phil Jolicoeur&amp;#039;s guitar, were better than SP is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6f8f12a9be1b595320d9f520b88889162df57e9","amp;dn":"Reset+%28early+Simple+Plan%29+-+No+Intensity+LP+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6f8f12a9be1b595320d9f520b88889162df57e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,248,241,42,155,225,181,149,50,13,159,82,11,136,136,145,98,223,87,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
