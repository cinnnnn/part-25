In this one-of-a-kind text, author V. Anton Spraul breaks down the ways that programmers solve problems and teaches you what other introductory books often ignore: how to Think Like a Programmer. Each chapter tackles a single programming concept, like classes, pointers, and recursion, and open-ended exercises throughout challenge you to apply your knowledge. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn how to:\n\nSplit problems into discrete components to make them easier to solve\nMake the most of code reuse with functions, classes, and libraries\nPick the perfect data structure for a particular job\nMaster more advanced programming tools like recursion and dynamic memory\nOrganize your thoughts and develop strategies to tackle particular types of problems\n\nAlthough the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s examples are written in C++, the creative problem-solving concepts they illustrate go beyond any particular language; in fact, they often reach outside the realm of computer science. As the most skillful programmers know, writing great code is a creative artÃ¢â‚¬â€and the first step in creating your masterpiece is learning to Think Like a Programmer.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
