Keep in\nmind that this crack is not perfect and that it has been\nreported that there is a performance slowdown when\nnavigating with the Windows Explorer file browser.\nNevertheless, it is a huge accomplishment that will help\nmake 64bit systems accessible for blind computer users.\nA step in the right direction?  Most definitely!\n\nOnce again, I am not the creator of the crack.  However,\nI hold the packaging, batch file, and installation guide\nto my name.  The installation guide is included in the\n.rar file.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nAs usual, questions or comments, post them here.\n\n\nSigned,\nGlitch\n\n\nDeveloper: Freedom Scientific\nInitial release: January 1995\nStable release: 11.0.1447 / May 18, 2010\nOperating system: Microsoft Windows\nType: Screen reader\nLicense: Proprietary\nWebsite: freedomscientific.com\n\nJAWS (an acronym for Job Access With Speech) is a screen\nreader, a software program for visually impaired users,\nproduced by the Blind and Low Vision Group at Freedom\nScientific of St. Petersburg, Florida, USA.\n\nIts purpose is to make personal computers using\nMicrosoft Windows accessible to blind and visually\nimpaired users.
