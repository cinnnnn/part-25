Harris, Jr. fulfilled a lifelong dream of becoming a Detroit police officer on September 19, 1994. For the next nine-and-a-half years, he served meritoriously in some of Detroit's most dangerous precincts and units, including vice. He joined the Executive Protection Unit (EPU) and served for five years with Chief of Police Isaiah McKinnon, Mayor Dennis Archer, and finally Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. Badge of Honor: Blowing the Whistle, Walter Harris's first book, is a chronicle of his service in law enforcement and a testament to the honor and integrity that he brought to the badge. It also offers a thoughtful guide to anyone in government or the private sector who might consider blowing the whistle on corruption.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d40cddfe1d3ceecfd38da3a962691ea3f8cd5eea","amp;dn":"Badge+of+Honor%3A+Blowing+the+Whistle+%28The+True+Story+of+a+Mayor%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d40cddfe1d3ceecfd38da3a962691ea3f8cd5eea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,12,221,254,29,60,238,207,211,141,163,169,98,105,30,163,248,205,94,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
