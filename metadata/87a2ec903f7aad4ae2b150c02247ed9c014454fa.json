It was written mostly between about midnight and 2am over a few nights, so IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m aware the language isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t great in places; I think some sections need to be re-written almost entirely. A third draft is in the works but it would be good to receive some feedback on this draft first.\n\nPlease email me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with constructive comments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87a2ec903f7aad4ae2b150c02247ed9c014454fa","amp;dn":"Money+and+Society","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87a2ec903f7aad4ae2b150c02247ed9c014454fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,162,236,144,63,122,173,74,226,177,80,192,34,71,237,156,1,68,84,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
