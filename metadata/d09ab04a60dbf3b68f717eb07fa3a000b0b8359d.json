Enjoy this great album!\n\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nSeventh Son of a Seventh Son is the seventh studio album by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released in 1988 by EMI in Europe and its sister label Capitol Records in the U.S. (it was re-released by Sanctuary/Columbia Records in the U.S. in 2002).\nIt is the first Iron Maiden release to feature keyboards and, along with The Number of the Beast and, later, Fear of the Dark and The Final Frontier, debuted at No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart. It also marks the first appearance of many progressive rock elements, particularly seen in the length and odd-time signatures of the title track &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son,&quot; and by the fact that it is a concept album.[2]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d09ab04a60dbf3b68f717eb07fa3a000b0b8359d","amp;dn":"Seventh+Son+of+a+Seventh+Son+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d09ab04a60dbf3b68f717eb07fa3a000b0b8359d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,154,176,74,96,219,243,182,143,113,126,176,127,163,160,0,176,184,53,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
