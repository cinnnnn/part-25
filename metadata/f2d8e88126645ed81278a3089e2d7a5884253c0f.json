Boys wanted to date her, girls wanted to be her, and somebody wanted her dead. . . .\n\nIt's the end of seventh grade, and Alison DiLaurentis and her friends are the girls of Rosewood Day. Ali runs her clique with an iron fist, and she's got enough dirt on Hanna, Emily, Aria, and Spencer to keep them in line. But Ali's hiding a dark secret of her own, something so huge it would destroy everything if it ever got out. She's desperate to keep the perfect life she's worked so hard to build, but in Rosewood deadly secrets have deadly consequences. . . .\n\nSet in the weeks leading up to Ali's murder, this special Pretty Little Liars tale is told by the prettiest little liar of all: Ali herself. For the first time ever, we see how the mystery began . . . and how Alison DiLaurentis's life ended.\nFor more quality uploads, please visit my profile and my thread :\n                &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/dovah12/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/dovah12/&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Dovah-Mixed-Collection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Dovah-Mixed-Collection&lt;/a&gt;\n\n================\n\nDovah\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2d8e88126645ed81278a3089e2d7a5884253c0f","amp;dn":"Sara+Shepard%2C+Ali%27s+Pretty+Little+Lies+%28Pretty+Little+Liars+0.5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2d8e88126645ed81278a3089e2d7a5884253c0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,216,232,129,38,100,94,216,18,120,163,8,158,45,122,88,132,37,60,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
