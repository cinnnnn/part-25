A DBA or developer can use this incredibly detailed information to significantly improve the performance of queries and better understand what's really going on inside a SQL Server system\n\nSQL Server DMVs in Action is a practical guide that shows how to obtain, interpret, and act on the information captured by DMVs to keep SQL Server in top shape. The 100+ samples provided in this book will help readers master DMVs and also give them a tested, working, and instantly reusable SQL code library.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:716627f3c27c1bc641a120e21adcf6c619373ad4","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2011%5D+SQL+Server+DMVs+in+Action+Better+Queries+with+Dynam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"716627f3c27c1bc641a120e21adcf6c619373ad4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,102,39,243,194,124,27,198,65,161,32,226,26,220,246,198,25,55,58,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
