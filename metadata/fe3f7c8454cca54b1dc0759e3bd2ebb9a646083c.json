It reached #5 in the UK Singles Chart. Then-unknown guitarist, session guitarist Jimmy Page played rhythm guitar in this song. Jimmy Page revealed this when Ritchie Blackmore asked him whether he played on this track. In his interview to Martin K. Webb he says\n\nJimmy used to run around telling everyone that he played on certain records. I asked him if he played on &quot;The Crying Game&quot; -that was Dave Berry- and &quot;My Baby Left Me.&quot; He said,&quot;Yes,I played guitar on that.&quot; What he didn't say was that he played rhythm guitar on it. Big Jim Sullivan played the solo on &quot;The Crying Game.&quot; He was livid when he heard what Jimmy was running around saying, because Jimmy had always used his guitar and everything. Jimmy played rhythm guitar because the lead guitar bit was a reading part and Jimmy couldn't read.\n\n\nThe song was covered by Boy George in 1992 as the theme to the Neil Jordan movie, The Crying Game.
