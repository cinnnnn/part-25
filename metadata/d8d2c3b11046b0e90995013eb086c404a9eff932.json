Then he's offered a job to do it for a living. It consumes his time, his mind, and eventually, his soul. Jason really should have stuck with freelance.\n\n3 - the academy\n\nSomething strange is happening at Tyler High. The laid-back principal has become unusually strict. The janitors no longer work nights because of what they hear. The students are frightened by what they see. And things are happening on school grounds that defy rational explanation. But there is an explanation. It's just nothing that anyone can begin to believe - or hope to survive.\n\n4 - the return\n\nHe leaves his job in California on Friday fully expecting to return on Monday. However when Glen Ridgeway travels to Kingman, Arizona to sell some land his parents left him he decides he wants to do a little traveling and take a vacation from his life. In Springerville Arizona, he sees some Indian ruins and accepts a job as an intern on an archeological dig in nearby Bower.\n\nThe dig is unusual even before Glen arrives. The site has yielded up a pouch of Greek money, a Saxon children's toy and a figurine with a mummified children's hand attached to it. The day Glen starts working, a woman finds a shard of pottery with her face on it. Glen finds the head of a being that is neither human nor animal but something evil. All across the southwest, strange events are occurring at Anasazi ruins, and museums and digs housing their artifacts. Glen and others are coming to believe the thing that wiped out the Anasazi is coming back and they must find a way to deal with it or become eradicated too.\n\n5 - the disappearance\n\nWhen Gary's girlfriend Joan vanishes, calls to her parents' home yield only dead air. Her school records are gone. There is no longer any evidence that she even existed. Most disturbing of all is what Gary does find: a warning and a tantalizing clue, leading to a mysterious backward cult known as the Homesteaders. Now Gary may be the next to disappear.\n\nepub and mobi. enjoy and seed, dont let the torrent die! :P","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8d2c3b11046b0e90995013eb086c404a9eff932","amp;dn":"5+Novels+By+Bentley+Little","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8d2c3b11046b0e90995013eb086c404a9eff932","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,210,195,177,16,70,176,233,9,149,1,62,176,134,196,4,169,239,249,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
