It has an advantage over MacStumbler/iStumbler/NetStumbler in that it uses monitor mode and passive scanning.\nKisMAC supports several third party PCMCIA cards - Orinoco, PrismII, Cisco Aironet, Atheros and PrismGT. USB Prism2 is supported as well, and USB Ralink support is in development. All of the internal AirPort hardware is supported as well.\nPlease note: This program is not intended for novices, but for professional users.
