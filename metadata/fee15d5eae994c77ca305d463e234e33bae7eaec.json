During a concert on September 12, 2007 in Ottawa, Cauterize announced they were breaking up; ending their more than ten years together as a band. The band had been scheduled to play on MTV Live in Canada on September 5 and canceled, which was later found to be due to the decision to break up the band. A formal announcement was posted on the band's message board and website on September 27, 2007. They played their final show together October 19, 2007 in their hometown of Oshawa. At the show they played songs from every album including the albums as TOE with their final song onstage being &quot;Curtain Call&quot; from the TOE album &quot;The Moment I Cauterize&quot;... a fitting way to end a good run.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&quot;Take Off Eh!&quot; (1999)\n\n1. \tSome Things Can't Change\n2. \tStill Waitin'\n3. \tBreathe\n4. \tFor The Fun Of It\n5. \tGrowin' Up\n6. \tWhat's Wrong With Yours?\n7. \tNot The Answer\n8. \tOne More Story\n9. \tGreen Grass And Cadillacs\n10. \tLet's Make It Last\n\n\n&quot;The Moment I Cauterize&quot; (2001)\n\n1. \tCauterize\n2. \tChoke\n3. \tSongs We Used To Sing\n4. \tShooting Stars\n5. \tPromise Me\n6. \tAre You Looking Up?\n7. \tTonight Feels Right\n8. \tAll Of Me\n9. \tFaceless\n10. \tCurtain Call\n\n\n&quot;Demo 02&quot; (2002)\n\n1.
