In Saved from Sacrifice theologian Mark Heim takes on this paradox, asserting that the cross must be understood against the whole history of human scapegoating violence.\n\nIn order to highlight the dimensions of his argument, Heim carefully and critically draws on the groundbreaking work of French theorist and biblical scholar RenÃƒÂ© Girard. Yet Heim goes beyond Girard to develop a comprehensive theology of the atonement and the cross through his fresh readings of well-known biblical passages and his exploration of the place of the victim. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0802832156&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0802832156&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1efba031b902ae99eac26f6d2ec8072c21ce1f3","amp;dn":"Saved+From+Sacrifice+S.+Mark+Heim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1efba031b902ae99eac26f6d2ec8072c21ce1f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,239,186,3,27,144,42,233,158,172,38,246,210,236,128,114,194,28,225,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
