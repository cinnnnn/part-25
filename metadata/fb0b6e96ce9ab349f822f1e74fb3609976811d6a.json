In this comprehensive volume Donald Proulx, the leading authority on Nasca ceramic iconography, presents his definitive statement on this extraordinary art through sound scholarship and a cautious, rigorous, and carefully explained methodology. The volume excels for its detailed description of the Nasca ceramic style (forms, iconography, phases), stimulating interpretation of the iconography, penetrating linkage of the pots and their iconography to the archaeologically known Nasca society, and diachronic treatment of the evolution of Nasca art and society. This will be a foundational text for many decades of future research.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½---Helaine Silverman, Department of Anthropology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb0b6e96ce9ab349f822f1e74fb3609976811d6a","amp;dn":"A+Sourcebook+of+Nasca+Ceramic+Iconography+-+Reading+a+Culture+Th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb0b6e96ce9ab349f822f1e74fb3609976811d6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,11,110,150,206,154,179,73,248,34,241,231,79,179,96,153,118,129,29,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
