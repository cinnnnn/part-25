It was an intracompany crossover that ran through DC's superhero annuals and concluded with a two-issue 'Bloodbath' miniseries written by Dan Raspler. The antagonists were a race of monstrous xenomorph-like parasites who killed humans for their spinal fluid. A small fraction of the parasite's victims survived and become super-heroes via their ordeal. This plot device introduced a wave of &quot;New Blood&quot; super-heroes into the DC Universe. Seven DC Comics series were spun out of the event: Blood Pack, Psyba-Rats, Hitman, Anima, Loose Cannon, Argus and Gunfire.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1f834717e0cbbdffa70371d5cbf4ac7cbe57757","amp;dn":"Bloodlines+Crossover+Event+1993","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1f834717e0cbbdffa70371d5cbf4ac7cbe57757","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,248,52,113,126,12,187,223,250,112,55,29,92,191,74,199,203,229,119,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
