The concert was organized by Izzy Young and Dylan advertised it when he appeared on Oscar Brand\\\\\\&amp;#039;s radio show, but only 54 people paid for tickets and Izzy Young lost money, but he also made history. A few years later, Dylan would sell out far larger concert halls and he keeps on performing 47 years later.\nA tape of the firat seven songs from this concert has been available for decades and \\\\\\&quot;This Land Is Your Land\\\\\\&quot; appeared on the \\\\\\&quot;No Direction Home\\\\\\&quot; soundtrack, but this 15-song tape started circulating just a few weeks ago. It\\\\\\&amp;#039;s an important find.\nThe sound quality is mostly very good, but remember that this is a bootleg recording, not an official release. The sound quality on some tracks is uneven.\nThe bitrate is quite low, but these files are identical to the files I received from a collector and this recording is to the best of my knowledge not currently circulating in better quality.\n\nTrack list:\n\n1. Pretty Peggy-O\n2. In The Pines \n3. Gospel Plow\n4. 1913 Massacre\n5. Backwater Blues\n6. Young But Daily Growing\n7. Fixin\\\\\\&amp;#039; To Die\n8. Talkin\\\\\\&amp;#039; Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues\n9. Man On The Street\n10. This Land Is Your Land\n11. Talking Merchant Marine\n12. Black Cross\n13. Freight Train Blues\n14. Song To Woody\n15.
