There is already one on TPB like this, but its for tablets. This one is for phones. (This one and the tablet one works very well, I use both of them)\n\nThis is version 2.2.0.121, and updates are not possible. The android market keeps track of what you buy, and if you try to update this, it'll say something to the effect of &quot;You have not purchased this app.&quot; Even though the update button is there on the App's page.\n\nPlease seed, go against SOPA, and I'll have another app up shortly (probably Wolfram|Alpha 1.04 for Android) keep your eyes open for that! Its an amazing knowledge engine.\n\nThanks everyone!\n~andersonrclark","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2009bec7228c68e1cac8bd087b79a5549e35df60","amp;dn":"Swiftkey+X+for+Android+%28Phone+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2009bec7228c68e1cac8bd087b79a5549e35df60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,9,190,199,34,140,104,225,202,200,189,8,123,121,165,84,158,53,223,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
