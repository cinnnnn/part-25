This text is designed for a calculus-based physics course at the beginning university and college level. It is written with the expectation that students have either taken or are currently taking a beginning course in calculus. Students taking a physics course based on this book should leave with a solid conceptual understanding of the fundamental physical laws and how these laws can be applied to solve many problems. The key word for this edition is &quot;understanding.&quot; The third edition of this text remains rigorous while including a number of new pedagogical elements which emphasize conceptual understanding.\n\nISBN: 0-13-191182-1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:525ebe9ee5fe72376e98b72312f88ebcc02908e6","amp;dn":"Fishbane+-+Physics+for+Scientists+and+Engineers+with+Modern+Phys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"525ebe9ee5fe72376e98b72312f88ebcc02908e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,94,190,158,229,254,114,55,110,152,183,35,18,248,142,188,192,41,8,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
