They attained this status mainly because of their two &quot;Keeper...&quot;-albums, true milestones of the Metal-history.\n\nOn the second &quot;Keeper&quot;-album the German band continues down the path that they had chosen with the first part. And they came up with most probably the best HELLOWEEN-songs of all times. After the short, classically influenced intro the band is handing out the Speed-racket. With &quot;Eagle Fly Free&quot; they deliver us with a great catchy tune, excelling in its wonderful melody and super-catchy chorus. A real hit! The following &quot;You Always Walk Alone&quot; is rather planted in the mid-tempo and isn't as accessible as &quot;Eagle...&quot;, but still this song grows with each rotation. On the funny &quot;Rise And Fall&quot; HELLOWEEN once more prove their sense of humour, not only because of the lyrics this song just spreads smiles on the listeners' faces. Just listen to the ending and you know what I mean. Cult! The following &quot;Dr. Stein&quot; hits in the same vein, especially the wonderful melody is what makes this song. The melodies all just plainly refuse to leave your brain again.\n\nGuitar-wise the band is standing on the top. Kai Hansen and Michael Weikath manage to make the songs even more immortal with their great solos and the, in my opinion, still best HELLOWEEN-singer Michael Kiske excels on all songs and proves that he is no second to MAIDEN-shouter Bruce Dickinson. On the energetic and variably structured &quot;We Got The Right&quot; you could almost think that Mr.Dickinson himself sings the song, so Kiske comes damn near to him. With numbers seven and eight on the track-list two of the best-known HELLOWEEN-classics are thundering through the speakers, the immortal speed-cracker &quot;March Of Time&quot; and the culty &quot;I Want Out&quot; rinse your auditory passages and lead to non-stop headbanging and singing along. The title-track with its more than 13 minutes playing time closes off the &quot;Keeper&quot;-story, begun on the first part. This song is a monument, to say the truth, a masterpiece. Here HELLOWEEN undoubtedly delivered their creative pinnacle! The closing &quot;Save Us&quot; doesn't take any prisoners and makes up a good rearguard of a true masterpiece.\n\nThe second &quot;Keeper&quot;-part surpasses the first one by a full length, everything fits here, no wonder that this album is regarded as a classic. HELLOWEEN hasn't managed to pass these two albums again, despite many good albums, the presence of century-melodies and great choruses is just too mighty. If there is a small flaw to this album then that the guitars could have been provided with a little more punch production-wise, but with these brilliant songs, who am I to criticise them? Just like said before, a milestone of the Metal-history, which showed many young bands the way.
