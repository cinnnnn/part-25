The incident dramatized herein is the kidnapping of a U.S. official somewhere in Latin America. The director's sympathies clearly lie with the kidnappers, especially since the official (played by Yves Montand), ostensibly an expert in traffic control, has been assigned as special advisor to the government's secret police, training these worthies in the art of the torturing of political prisoners. Uruguay was the country where this story actually took place; though no names are given, there's little doubting the identity of Costa-Gavras' fictional locale. Despite its up-to-date radicalism, State of Siege adheres to time-honored Hollywood formula, with ugly, vulgar bad guys vs. handsome, articulate good guys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Yves Montand, Renato Salvatori, O.E.

Mitrione (8 min, 720p): The character Yves Montand plays in State of Siege, Philip Michael Santore, was inspired by the real-life figure of Dan A. Mitrione, who was kidnapped by the left-wing radical group Tupamaros in Uruguay on July 31, 1970. Presented here are excerpts from NBC's coverage of the kidnapping case. These excerpts originally aired from August 8 to August 12, 1970.\r\n\r\n- Costa-Gavras and Peter Cowie (32 min, 720p): In this new filmed conversation, director Costa-Gavras explains how State of Siege became a reality (it was shot in Chile with the approval of Salvador Allende), Franco Solinas contribution, the casting of Yves Montand (the French actor also appeared in Costa-Gavras' hit Z and The Confession), some of the real political events that are partially recreated in the film, the lensing by cinematographer Pierre-William Glenn (FranÃ§ois Truffaut's A Gorgeous Girl Like Me, Day for Night), the film's critical reception in Europe and the United States, etc. The conversation was filmed at the Cinematheque francaise in January 2015 exclusively for Criterion.\r\n\r\n1.
