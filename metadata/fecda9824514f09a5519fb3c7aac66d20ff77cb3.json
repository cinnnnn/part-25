A book that covers both past and new applications for hydrocolloid beads, their properties, and how to deliberately change them, is crucial. Currently there are only chapters in a handful of books covering these topics; there are no books fully devoted to them. Water-Soluble Polymer Beads: Fundamentals and Applications fills this void. This book describes all methods of bead production and techniques to change and to estimate their physical and chemical properties. A full description of past and recent developments and applications of beads in the fields of agriculture, biotechnology, environmental studies, medicine and food are presented","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fecda9824514f09a5519fb3c7aac66d20ff77cb3","amp;dn":"Polymer+Macro-+and+Micro-Gel+Beads+-+Fundamentals+and+Applicatio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fecda9824514f09a5519fb3c7aac66d20ff77cb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,205,169,130,69,20,240,154,85,25,251,60,122,172,102,210,15,247,124,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
