Eminem, however, opts for deeper cuts and rarities from\nhis arsenal, including a brand new song called &quot;Taking My Ball&quot; that will\nfeature exclusively on the DJ Hero Renegade disc. Both rappers hand-selected\ntheir respective track lists.\n\n&quot;The tracks we put on this disc are mostly overlooked or rarer favorites of\nmine from all different parts of my career,&quot; Eminem said. &quot;I also put a\nbrand new, unheard song on there so even the biggest fan has something new.&quot;\nDJ Hero and DJ Hero Renegade Edition will both be released October 27th,\nbut Slim Shady fans can hear &quot;Taking My Ball&quot; October 16th when the track\ndebuts on Em's Sirius radio station Shade45.
