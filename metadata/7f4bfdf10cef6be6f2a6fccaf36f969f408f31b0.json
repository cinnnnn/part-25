Her words reflect the irrepressible \nattitudes and actions of all the women and men who tell their stories here.\n\nAs with all the titles in New Internationalist's World Changing imprint, Nine Lives sees opportunity in \nthe midst of adversity and presents the life stories of people who have been confronted with seemingly \ninsurmountable obstacles, opposition, and oppression.\nWhether it is human rights activist Harry Wu, who spent nineteen years in Chinese labor camps, \nor Nobel Laureate and President of Costa Rica Oscar Arias Sanchez, each of the nine voices in this \ncollection has confronted an urgent and inescapable need to dig deep, either to rescue themselves or \nto forge a fresh way forward for others.\nTo understand the key stories behind the headlines, Peter Braaksma believes that it is essential to feel the\n personal, intimate experience of people working on the frontline of human rights and humanitarian issues; that the stories, uninterrupted and unpolished, must speak for themselves.\nReading like nine mini-novels, the nine remarkable stories belong to \nBassam Aramin (Palestinian National Authority), Monireh Baradaran (Iran), Youk Chhang (Cambodia), \nSompop Jantraka (Thailand), Malalai Joya (Afghanistan), Chaeli Mycroft (South Africa), \nOscar Arias Sanchez (Costa Rica), and Harry Wu (China).\n\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f4bfdf10cef6be6f2a6fccaf36f969f408f31b0","amp;dn":"Nine+Lives-Making+the+Impossible+Possible%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f4bfdf10cef6be6f2a6fccaf36f969f408f31b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,75,253,241,12,239,107,230,242,166,252,202,243,111,150,159,64,143,49,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
