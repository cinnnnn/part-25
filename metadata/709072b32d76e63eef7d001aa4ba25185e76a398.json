I Love You But I Don't Know What To Say\n\nBeyond Ryan AdamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ well-documented personal life ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ his marriage to Mandy Moore; his battle with the hearing disorder MeniereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s disease ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ lies the fleshy heart and soul of a brilliant singer and songwriter. His fragile lyrics and his voice, sounding strong and clear, better than it has in years, twist into a perfect union on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAshes &amp; Fire.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nStill scrappy and floppy-haired at 36, Adams has released almost one album a year since leaving alt-country band Whiskeytown a decade ago, starting with his first solo album, 2000ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeartbreaker.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAshes &amp; FireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ recalls the best of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeartbreaker,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ except inverted, matured. Instead of strumming acoustically about the shreds of a relationship, he sings softly and nostalgically about distant youth and a love-filled future: its hopefulness, its vulnerability.\n\nBallads ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLucky NowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œInvisible RiversideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ have the kind of clamped-to-your-brain melodies that drift into territory worthy of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢70s classics. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChains of LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is upbeat, with an orchestral kick. Norah JonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ piano fills in the gaps on several songs, alongside his wifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s harmonies and keyboard by Tom Petty right-hand Benmont Tench. The smoothness of producer Glyn Johns (Bob Dylan, the Band) can be felt everywhere. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Love You But I DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Know What to SayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ actually says it all, with words that set your eyes close to tears: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI promise you/ I will keep you safe from harm.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nEmbedded in a world of crashing, pounding pop music, AdamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ solo rawness brings with it sweet release.\n\ncd ripped by another person who I am grateful to.\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:709072b32d76e63eef7d001aa4ba25185e76a398","amp;dn":"Ryan+Adams...Ashes+%26amp%3B+Fire%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"709072b32d76e63eef7d001aa4ba25185e76a398","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,144,114,179,45,118,230,62,239,125,0,26,164,186,37,24,94,118,163,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
