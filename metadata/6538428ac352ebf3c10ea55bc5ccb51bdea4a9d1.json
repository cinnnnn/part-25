Data tools like Hadoop are batch-oriented; theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re good at taking a set of data, analyzing it, and giving you the result later. But these tools are not particularly good at handling streaming data: data that is constantly arriving, and results that are changing as fast as the data arrives. Storm is a new tool that solves that problem. This book gets you started with it.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1. Basics\nChapter 2. Getting Started\nChapter 3. Topologies\nChapter 4.
