Consisting of Sandi Lee Hughes, Thaila Zucchi, Ashley Taylor Dawson, Rebecca Hunter and Sam Bloom (the first letter of each band member's name making up the &quot;stars&quot; of their group name), they were probably best noted for having their own television show, STARStreet*, on CITV between 2001 and 2002.\n\n\n\nAllSTARS* is the only self-titled debut album released by allSTARS*. It was released on 13 May 2002. It charted at No.43 - spending only 2 weeks in the UK Album Charts. After that, the band parted ways with their record company, Island, and split up soon after, in June 2002\n\n\n==== &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allstars_(band)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allstars_(band)&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Allstars/dp/B000066A2X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Allstars/dp/B000066A2X&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n========================================\nLAME MP3 CBR 320kbps ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0db71580164956afff84add98bc5e6f9859f4b3","amp;dn":"Allstars+-+Allstars+%282002%29+320kbps+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0db71580164956afff84add98bc5e6f9859f4b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,219,113,88,1,100,149,106,255,248,74,221,152,188,94,111,152,89,244,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
