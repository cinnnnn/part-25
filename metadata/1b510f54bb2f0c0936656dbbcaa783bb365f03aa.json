There are some spots on the maps which have errors, such as misaligned bits of map, but these errors are in the streetdirectory.com.au maps and I can do nothing about them. When that site corrects the errors I wil rebuild the maps and re-release them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b510f54bb2f0c0936656dbbcaa783bb365f03aa","amp;dn":"Melways+for+OziExplorer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b510f54bb2f0c0936656dbbcaa783bb365f03aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,81,15,84,187,47,12,9,54,101,109,187,202,167,131,187,54,95,3,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
