This book tells the engaging story of Europa, the oceanic moon. It features a large number of stunning images of the ocean moonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surface, clearly displaying the spectacular crack patterns, extensive rifts and ridges, and refrozen pools of exposed water filled with rafts of displaced ice. Coverage also features firsthand accounts of GalileoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mission to Jupiter and its moons. The book tells the rough and tumble inside story of a very human enterprise in science that lead to the discovery of a fantastic new world that might well harbor life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49cc4fe782986317d5613046b933e34e93e25fe4","amp;dn":"Unmasking+Europa_+The+Search+for+Life+on+Jupiter%27s+Ocean+Moon+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49cc4fe782986317d5613046b933e34e93e25fe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,204,79,231,130,152,99,23,213,97,48,70,185,51,227,78,147,226,95,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
