The book is designed as a text for upper-undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a primer for non-specialists and general readers interested in learning about one of humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enduring blights.\nFully updated to reflect the latest thinking in this rapidly developing field, this new edition:\n*provides an introduction to genocide as both a historical phenomenon and an analytical-legal concept, including an extended discussion of the concept of genocidal intent, and the dynamism and contingency of genocidal processes\n*discusses the role of state-building, imperialism, war, and social revolution in fueling genocide\n*supplies a wide range of full-length case studies of genocides worldwide, each with an accompanying box-text\n*explores perspectives on genocide from the social sciences, including psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science/international relations, and gender studies\n*considers &quot;The Future of Genocide,&quot; with attention to historical memory and genocide denial; initiatives for truth, justice, and redress; and strategies of intervention and prevention.\n\nWritten in clear and lively prose, liberally sprinkled with over 100 illustrations and maps, and including personal testimonies from genocide survivors, Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction has established itself as the core textbook of the new generation of genocide scholarship. An accompanying website (www.genocidetext.net) features a broad selection of supplementary materials, teaching aids, and Internet resources.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;Based on immense scholarship, Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction is much more than an indispensable text for students of this seemingly intractable phenomenon. With its global and interdisciplinary perspectives, it consistently advances our understanding of genocidal events on many fronts. Provocative yet balanced, Adam JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second edition at once summarizes and defines this burgeoning field.&quot;\nA. Dirk Moses, University of Sydney and the European University Institute, Florence\n\nAlready the most wide-ranging, accessible and clear-sighted introduction to the subject, the significantly expanded 2nd edition unflinchingly extends the range of its discussion to include contentious issues such as 'cultural' genocide, whether post 9/11 terrorism falls under the rubric, and the wider scope of Ottoman violence against Christian 'minorities' in 1915. Compassionate, searching, up-to-the minute and sometimes even electrifying in its prose this is the book I will be particularly recommending to my university students of genocide.\nMark Levene, University of Southampton, UK\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews for 1st edition:\nWith its interdisciplinary approach and bevy of case studies, 'Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction' will surely become the seminal text for students of genocide. Written in an engaging and conversational style, the book not only explores existing frameworks, but expands the boundaries of genocide studies with attention to issues such as gender and the future of genocide. Perhaps best of all, Jones educates and inspires the reader to become an active and responsible global citizen.\nNicholas A. Robins, Duke University, USA\n\nThis is the best introductory text available to students of genocide studies. Written in clear, elegant prose and supported by a wealth of authoritative sources, GENOCIDE: A COMPREHENSIVE INTRODUCTION is likely to become the gold standard by which all subsequent introductions to this enormously important subject will be measured\nKenneth J. Campbell, Professor of Political Science, University of Delaware, USA\n\nThis wide-ranging inquest into the dynamics of genocidal violence stands as a major contribution to the dismal science of 'massacrology.' More than a collection of case studies, it offers a depth of critical insight and a richness of data seldom matched in comparative studies of genocide. Informed by a formidable erudition, and a deep personal sensitivity to the horrors that he describes, Adam Jones's splendid book is a milestone in the literature on mass crimes and genocide.\nRene Lemarchand, Department of Political Science, University of Florida, USA\n\nThe subtitle says it all: unique in the literature, this book provides a thorough, comprehensive introduction to the subject of genocide. Jones, a Yale political scientist and genocide scholar, delivers a very readable, intellectually stimulating text. The overall perspective is interdisciplinary. Relevant research and insights from psychology, sociology, and anthropology are included; maps and illustrations complement many of the examples and case studies. A Web site http://www.genocidetext.net supplements the book. The historical coverage ranges from discussions of genocide in the Hebrew Bible to contemporary abominations in Sudan's Darfur region. Commendably, there are thoughtful chapters on the significance of gender, memory and denial, and postgenocide tribunals. The book concludes with strategies to anticipate future genocides and intervene when necessary. Readers are encouraged as responsible citizens to consider their reactions to genocide. Summing Up: Essential. All readership levels.\nP. G.
