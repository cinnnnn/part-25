The audio production was executive produced by Maya Thomas, directed and produced by Kevin Thompson, and was written by John Whitman.\n\nDC Comics released an audio dramatization of the series Kingdom Come in 1998 featuring the voice talent of Mike Mearian, Don Peoples, Garet Scott, John Cunningham, Kent Broadhurst, Jeff David, Chuck Cooper, Harry Goz, Barbara Rosenblat, Craig Zakarian, Mike Arkin, Bob Lydiard, Peter Newman, Birgit Darby, Mark Finley, Igot Goldin, Macintyre Dixon, and Chloe Patellis, along with the guest voices of Dennis O\\&amp;#039;Neil, Mark Waid, Mike Carlin, Dan Raspler, Charles Kochman, Peter Tomasi, Greg Ross, Janet Harney, Elisabeth Vincentelli.\n\nThis is not available on CD and is currently out of print, so I thought it would be best to put this torrent out there.  I hope you enjoy, and please, seed this if you can!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e68f27c6a3a66d8fff3162a8ad884267fe01d874","amp;dn":"Kingdom+Come.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e68f27c6a3a66d8fff3162a8ad884267fe01d874","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,143,39,198,163,166,109,143,255,49,98,168,173,136,66,103,254,1,216,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
