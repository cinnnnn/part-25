This UNDUB has\n  the USA english text with the original Japanese spoken dialog.  \n  \n  Enjoy one of my favorite games the way it was meant to be played!\n  \n                    -- Release Notes --\n  \n  If I put a word here for every hour spent working on this you&amp;#039;d\n  be reading an epic novel filled with hope and despair.\n  \n  For some reason tri-Ace felt the need for a baffling variety of\n  encryption and deliberate obfuscation.  In the end I implemented\n  over a dozen decryption, compression and archiving methods...\n  \n  It&amp;#039;s possible that only the crazy tri-Ace developers will ever\n  really appreciate the work this project required. ;)\n  \n  Anyway, at long last, the event, movie and battle voices are now\n  restored to Japanese.  The beautiful CG movies include subtitles.\n\n  Note that the game relies heavily on streaming data off the disc,\n  so you must produce a quality burn or will experience problems.\n  \n  Hackers/coders want to contact me?  Look for a fluffy kitty.\n  \n                   *** USA PUBLISHERS ***\n  \n  Please stop ruining your games with such horrible english dubs!\n  We are forced to go to extremes like this because you are making\n  the games we love unplayable!\n  \n  Consider multi-language or special-edition releases with the\n  original high quality Japanese voices.  \n  \n  Especially you, tri-Ace!  Please spare me doing this again. :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:269f6090f4717b91f7a05adfa6eb59b1b7e50859","amp;dn":"Valkyrie+Profile+2+Silmeria+USA+UNDUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"269f6090f4717b91f7a05adfa6eb59b1b7e50859","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,159,96,144,244,113,123,145,247,160,90,223,166,235,89,177,183,229,8,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
