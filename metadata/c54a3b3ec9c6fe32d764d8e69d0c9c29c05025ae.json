Jacob is looking for new territory--and he's bringing along the Landry secret weapon...his grandfather, Troy's dad...Duffy Landry. Meanwhile, cousins Austyn and Blake are also headed toward new ground. All season, they've been filling a daily quota for their buyer Coach...but Coach has leveled a new challenge: to find a honey hole of their own that delivers big results. Junior Edwards prides himself on finding the hidden spots that no one else would think to visit. Today, he's targeting the most unlikely of all--a pool that's behind a metal dike. Veteran hunter Bruce is also forging a new road to new grounds. He's upping the odds of success, stacking the deck with very special bait: blood-injected rotten chicken.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c54a3b3ec9c6fe32d764d8e69d0c9c29c05025ae","amp;dn":"Swamp+People+S03E12.HDTV.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c54a3b3ec9c6fe32d764d8e69d0c9c29c05025ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,74,59,62,201,198,254,50,215,100,216,230,157,12,156,41,192,80,37,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
