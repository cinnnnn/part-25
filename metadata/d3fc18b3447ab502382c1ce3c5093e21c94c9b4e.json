It's taken that long to track down every scrap of information about this twentieth century titan. Gilbert received his appointment after Randolph Churchill's death, more than 20 years ago.\n\nRandolph had started his father's biography, Gilbert assisted him and was there to take charge after Randolph's untimely death. From this new book emerges an intimate portrait of Churchill's character, untrammeled by formality and the fruit of Gilbert's work.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3fc18b3447ab502382c1ce3c5093e21c94c9b4e","amp;dn":"In+Search+of+Churchill+-+Martin+Gilbert+++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3fc18b3447ab502382c1ce3c5093e21c94c9b4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,252,24,179,68,122,181,2,56,44,28,227,197,9,62,33,201,76,155,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
