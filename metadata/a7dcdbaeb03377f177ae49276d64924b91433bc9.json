However, the nature of the work often requires broad knowledge in the interrelated areas of physics, chemistry, biomechanics, and engineering. Covering cases as varied as assessment of workplace accidents to the investigation of Halliburton in the BP oil spill, Forensic Engineering Fundamentals is a comprehensive introduction to the many diverse facets of the field that forensic engineers must be familiar with in their practice.\nTopics include\n\n    The role of the forensic engineer\n    Structures, structural distress, and the importance of standards and codes\n    The failure of appliancesÃ¢â‚¬â€the cause of many water- or fire-related losses\n    Slips, trips, and falls of pedestrians and the accessibility of walking surfaces Industrial incidents involving loss of equipment, injury and loss of life, as well as OSHA and MSHA regulations\n    Standard accident reconstruction involving vehicles\n    Electrical incidents and lightning and the effect of electrical energy on the human body\n    Analysis of fires with an emphasis on thermodynamics, testing, and simulation\n    Carbon monoxide incidents and common fire suppression and warning systems, as well as the various NFPA codes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7dcdbaeb03377f177ae49276d64924b91433bc9","amp;dn":"Forensic+Engineering+Fundamentals+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7dcdbaeb03377f177ae49276d64924b91433bc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,220,219,174,176,51,119,241,119,174,73,39,109,100,146,75,145,67,59,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
