Starting out as a con man, Draka slowly awakens to his destiny and begins to battle the forces of evil, aided by Tesla, a female vampire who's switched sides, and Kurjak, a tough human solider.&quot;\n\nIn the first book we find Draka, haunted by horrible nightmares, walking the countryside trying to make money ridding small villages of what the naive citizens believe to be evil vampires. Draka puts on a front, claiming to be a dampyr while not knowing the truth, until he's summoned by soldiers who are under attack by real vampires, only to discover that his nightmares are true - he is, in fact, a dampyr.\n\nThe series is written by Mauro Boselli and Maurizio Columbo, while a variety of artists provide the disturbing imagery for &quot;Dampyr.&quot; &quot;These stories were and are being drawn by famous Italian artists such as Mario Rossi (known as 'Majo'), Luca Rossi, Maurizio Dotti, Nicola Genzianella and others. They all are very well known in Europe -- Italy in particular -- but will be new to the U.S. audience.&quot;\n\nTorrent collects issues 1-7, issue 8, the last released by IDW, has yet to be scanned.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e487047496dc5eb46079bfedb5fb13ef85755c4e","amp;dn":"Dampyr+01-07","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e487047496dc5eb46079bfedb5fb13ef85755c4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,135,4,116,150,220,94,180,96,121,191,237,181,251,19,239,133,117,92,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
