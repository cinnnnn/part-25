She has reason and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vowed not only never to get involved with another one again, but also to exact vengeance on her best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lying, cheating, rat-bastard husband. Since Luke Stark, Ava's childhood crush, is now a badass mother, she thinks to enlist him, but changes her mind at the last second. Too late. Luke knows sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to something and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already seen many a Rock Chick try to fight her own battles without the Hot Bunch stepping in. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s having none of it. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s having none of him. The clash of the Rock Chick and Hot Guy begins, but LukeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got the advantage. He has handcuffs and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not afraid to use them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03447b08d01ee3275dbccba6e73d1dd5a4e2c0ae","amp;dn":"Kristen+Ashley+-+Rock+Chick+05+-+Rock+Chick+Revenge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03447b08d01ee3275dbccba6e73d1dd5a4e2c0ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,68,123,8,208,30,227,39,93,188,203,166,231,61,29,213,164,226,192,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
