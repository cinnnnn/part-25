I wasn't resizing first since it cuts the uncompressed data by just over 100GB. Which to me, didn't sound good, but I think it actually does look better.\n\nSo feel free to let me know how you think it compares to my previous rips.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:858cec556eb8939d41bc1f72918957e65aa05424","amp;dn":"Smallville+S09E19+HQ+HDTV+AC3+DivX+%28Re-Encode+From+720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"858cec556eb8939d41bc1f72918957e65aa05424","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,140,236,85,110,184,147,157,65,188,31,114,145,137,87,230,90,160,84,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
