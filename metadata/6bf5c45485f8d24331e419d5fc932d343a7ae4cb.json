I finally have the full album, i guess theres a lot stuff floating around of this artist and i think hes worth the listening to, better than most stuff these days\n\n\n{Copied from an anonymous poster}\n\n\nThis mixtape is the debut underground release from new artist Zulu. Zulu is an unsigned artist, who uses his music to inspire thinking and change. this much political and racially driven album, is infused with Tupac Shakur, giving us a fresh, new sound, and some things to think about. Enjoy!!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bf5c45485f8d24331e419d5fc932d343a7ae4cb","amp;dn":"AMW+Zulu+Muziq+Mixtape+%7BfullmixtapePromo%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bf5c45485f8d24331e419d5fc932d343a7ae4cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,245,196,84,133,248,210,67,49,228,25,213,252,147,45,52,58,122,228,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
