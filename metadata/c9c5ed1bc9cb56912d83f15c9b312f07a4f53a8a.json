It is, in fact, a highly complex, protective, and intelligent system that can bolster health and healing from head to toe. A number of factorsâ€•from your diet, lifestyle, and the illnesses youâ€™ve had to the medications you take or the toxins and people you interact with on a daily basisâ€•can throw your immune system off balance, resulting in excessive inflammation that worsens allergies and pain and can even lead to serious health conditions.\r\n\r\nDonâ€™t panic: You can feed, nourish, and teach your immune system to work better, which will result in lifelong health. In Ultimate Immunity, experts Drs. Elson Haas and Sondra Barrett guide you through a unique plan aimed at balancing, amplifying, and managing your immune health.\r\nBeginning with easy-to-understand explanations of what the immune system is, how it works, and how it fails, then moving on to five important ways to reset it, Ultimate Immunity provides the answers you need. Including diet, exercise, and stress-reduction tips, as well as testimonials from people who used these methods to overcome chronic pain and immune health issues for good, Ultimate Immunity is your guidebook to total health.\r\n\r\nUltimate Immunity: Supercharge Your Bodyâ€™s Natural Healing Powers by Elson Haas, Sondra Barrett\r\nEnglish | 2015 | ISBN-10: 162336390X| 352 pages | ePUB |3.10 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9c5ed1bc9cb56912d83f15c9b312f07a4f53a8a","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Immunity%3A+Supercharge+Your+Bodys+Natural+Healing+Power","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9c5ed1bc9cb56912d83f15c9b312f07a4f53a8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,197,237,27,201,203,86,145,45,131,241,92,155,49,47,7,164,245,58,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
