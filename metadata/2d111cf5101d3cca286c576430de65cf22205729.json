Served with technical refinement and a lot of groove, they kick ass while being varied and distinct.\n\n\nSince their founding in 2005, the guys and gal from Hanover left their marks as being a rousing live band, carrying the audience with dashing songs and sweaty shows.\n\n\nOn tours with Overkill and Onslaught, Cripper spread their virus throughout Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce a big festival got infected, they gladly book the band repeatedly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ therefore Cripper played several times on festivals like Summer Breeze, Wacken Rocks, Metalfest and Rockharz Open Air.\n\n\nBut there's even more Ã¢â‚¬â€œ boarding the well-known 70,000 Tons Of Metal cruise ship from Miami twice, playing the Brutal Assault festival in Czech Republic, shows at the Bang Your Head, in Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Austria, Switzerland and being invited to enter the stage of the Slovenian Metaldays 5 (!) times let Cripper gain international recognition and a continuously growing fanbase.\n\n\nSo far Cripper have released three studio albums and with that formed their distinctive style. Especially on their current album &quot;Antagonist&quot;, Cripper sound mature and show an exuberant joy of playing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creative works of this highly motivated selfmade-team is always showing through in three different aspects: the album artworks, merchandise and so far four complex and artistic music video productions, that the band has self-produced from A to Z.\n\n\nHaving been exposed to CRIPPER at Metaldays 2013, Metal Blade Records will release the upcoming 4th album &quot;Hyena&quot; which is expected for a November release. Giving CRIPPER an extra boost as they march into the future!\n\n\n\n\nDiscography:\nKiller Escort      2006\nFreak Inside       2008\nDevil Reveals      2009\nAntagonist         2012\nHyena              2014\n\n\n\nLineup:\nBritta &quot;Elchkuh&quot; GÃƒÂ¶rtz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vocals\nChristian &quot;Knitzel&quot; BrÃƒÂ¶henhorst Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitars, Backing Vocals\nJonathan Stenger Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitars\nGerrit Mohrmann Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass Guitar\nDennis Weber Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums\n\n\n\n\nInfo:\nArtist: Cripper\nAlbum: HyÃƒÂ«na\nGenre: Thrash\nYear: 2014\nCountry Of Origin: Germany\nAudio codec: MP3\nRiptype: Tracks\nBitrate: CBR 320 kbps\nSize: 118.68 MB\nIncluded - Front Cover\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
